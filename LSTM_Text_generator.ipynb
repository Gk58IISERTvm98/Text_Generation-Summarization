              "'preface\\n\\n\\nsupposing that truth is a woman--what then?  is there not\\nground\\nfor suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have\\nbeen\\ndogmatists, have failed to understand women--that the terrible\\nseriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid\\ntheir addresses to truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for\\nwinning a woman?  certainly she has never allowed herself to be won;\\nand\\nat present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged\\nmien--if,\\nindeed, it stands at all!  for there are scoffers who\\nmaintain that it\\nhas fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground--nay\\nmore, that it is at\\nits last gasp.  but to speak seriously, there are\\ngood grounds for hoping\\nthat all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever\\nsolemn, whatever conclusive\\nand decided airs it has assumed, may have\\nbeen only a noble puerilism\\nand tyronism; and probably the time is at\\nhand when it will be once\\nand again understood what has actually\\nsufficed for the basis of such\\nimposing and absolute philosophical\\nedifices as the dogmatists have\\nhitherto reared: perhaps some popular\\nsuperstition of immemorial time\\n(such as the soul-superstition, which,\\nin the form of subject- and\\nego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing\\nmischief): perhaps some\\nplay upon words, a deception on the part of\\ngrammar, or an\\naudacious generalization of very restricted, very\\npersonal, very\\nhuman--all-too-human facts.  the philosophy of the\\ndogmatists, it is to\\nbe hoped, was only a promise for thousands of\\nyears afterwards, as was\\nastrology in still earlier times, in the\\nservice of which probably more\\nlabour, gold, acuteness, and patience\\nhave been spent than on any\\nactual science hitherto: we owe to it, and\\nto its \"super-terrestrial\"\\npretensions in asia and egypt, the grand\\nstyle of architecture.  it seems\\nthat in order to inscribe themselves\\nupon the heart of humanity with\\neverlasting claims, all great things\\nhave first to wander about the\\nearth as enormous and awe-inspiring\\ncaricatures: dogmatic philosophy has\\nbeen a caricature of this kind--\\nfor instance, the vedanta doctrine in\\nasia, and platonism in europe.\\nlet us not be ungrateful to it, although\\nit must certainly be\\nconfessed that the worst, the most tiresome,\\nand the most dangerous of\\nerrors hitherto has been a dogmatist\\nerror--namely, plato\\'s invention\\nof pure spirit and the good in itself.\\nbut now when it has been\\nsurmounted, when europe, rid of this nightmare,\\ncan again draw breath\\nfreely and at least enjoy a healthier--sleep,\\nwe, whose duty is\\nwakefulness itself, are the heirs of all the strength\\nwhich the\\nstruggle against this error has fostered.  it amounted to\\nthe very\\ninversion of truth, and the denial of the perspective--the\\nfundamental\\ncondition--of life, to speak of spirit and the good as plato\\nspoke of\\nthem; indeed one might ask, as a physician: \"how did such a\\nmalady\\nattack that finest product of antiquity, plato?  had the wicked\\nsocrates really corrupted him?  was socrates after all a corrupter of\\nyouths, and deserved his hemlock?\"  but the struggle against plato,\\nor\\n--to speak plainer, and for the \"people\"--the struggle against\\nthe\\necclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity (for\\nchristianity is platonism for the \"people\"), produced in europe\\na\\nmagnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere\\npreviously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the\\nfurthest goals.  as a matter of fact, the european feels this tension\\nas\\na state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand\\nstyle to\\nunbend the bow: once by means of jesuitism, and the second\\ntime by means\\nof democratic enlightenment--which, with the aid of\\nliberty of the press\\nand newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it\\nabout that the spirit\\nwould not so easily find itself in \"distress\"!\\n(the germans invented\\ngunpowder--all credit to them!  but they again\\nmade things square--they\\ninvented printing.) but we, who are neither\\njesuits, nor democrats,\\nnor even sufficiently germans, we good\\neuropeans, and free, very free\\nspirits--we have it still, all the\\ndistress of spirit and all the\\ntension of its bow!  and perhaps also\\nthe arrow, the duty, and, who\\nknows?  the goal to aim at....\\n\\nsils\\nmaria upper engadine, june, 1885.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter i.  prejudices of\\nphilosophers\\n\\n\\n1. the will to truth, which is to tempt us to many a\\nhazardous\\nenterprise, the famous truthfulness of which all\\nphilosophers have\\nhitherto spoken with respect, what questions has\\nthis will to truth not\\nlaid before us!  what strange, perplexing,\\nquestionable questions!  it is\\nalready a long story; yet it seems as\\nif it were hardly commenced.  is\\nit any wonder if we at last grow\\ndistrustful, lose patience, and turn\\nimpatiently away?  that this\\nsphinx teaches us at last to ask questions\\nourselves?  who is it\\nreally that puts questions to us here?  what really\\nis this \"will to\\ntruth\" in us?  in fact we made a long halt at the\\nquestion as to the\\norigin of this will--until at last we came to an\\nabsolute standstill\\nbefore a yet more fundamental question.  we inquired\\nabout the value\\nof this will.  granted that we want the truth: why not\\nrather untruth?\\nand uncertainty?  even ignorance?  the problem of the\\nvalue of truth\\npresented itself before us--or was it we who presented\\nourselves\\nbefore the problem?  which of us is the oedipus here?  which\\nthe\\nsphinx?  it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of\\ninterrogation.  and could it be believed that it at last seems to us\\nas\\nif the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the\\nfirst\\nto discern it, get a sight of it, and risk raising it?  for\\nthere is risk\\nin raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.\\n\\n2.\\n\"how could anything originate out of its opposite?  for example, truth\\nout of error?  or the will to truth out of the will to deception?  or\\nthe\\ngenerous deed out of selfishness?  or the pure sun-bright vision\\nof the\\nwise man out of covetousness?  such genesis is impossible;\\nwhoever dreams\\nof it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the\\nhighest\\nvalue must have a different origin, an origin of their own--in\\nthis\\ntransitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of\\ndelusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source.  but rather in\\nthe lap of being, in the intransitory, in the concealed god, in the\\n\\'thing-in-itself--there must be their source, and nowhere else!\"--this\\nmode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which\\nmetaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation\\nis at the back of all their logical procedure; through this \"belief\"\\nof\\ntheirs, they exert themselves for their \"knowledge,\" for something\\nthat\\nis in the end solemnly christened \"the truth.\"  the fundamental\\nbelief of\\nmetaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values.  it\\nnever occurred\\neven to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very\\nthreshold (where\\ndoubt, however, was most necessary); though they had\\nmade a solemn\\nvow, \"de omnibus dubitandum.\"  for it may be doubted,\\nfirstly, whether\\nantitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the\\npopular valuations\\nand antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians\\nhave set their\\nseal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates,\\nmerely provisional\\nperspectives, besides being probably made from some\\ncorner, perhaps from\\nbelow--\"frog perspectives,\" as it were, to borrow\\nan expression current\\namong painters.  in spite of all the value which\\nmay belong to the true,\\nthe positive, and the unselfish, it might be\\npossible that a higher\\nand more fundamental value for life generally\\nshould be assigned to\\npretence, to the will to delusion, to\\nselfishness, and cupidity.  it\\nmight even be possible that what\\nconstitutes the value of those good and\\nrespected things, consists\\nprecisely in their being insidiously\\nrelated, knotted, and crocheted\\nto these evil and apparently opposed\\nthings--perhaps even in being\\nessentially identical with them.  perhaps!\\nbut who wishes to concern\\nhimself with such dangerous \"perhapses\"!\\nfor that investigation one\\nmust await the advent of a new order of\\nphilosophers, such as will\\nhave other tastes and inclinations, the\\nreverse of those hitherto\\nprevalent--philosophers of the dangerous\\n\"perhaps\" in every sense of\\nthe term.  and to speak in all seriousness, i\\nsee such new\\nphilosophers beginning to appear.\\n\\n3. having kept a sharp eye on\\nphilosophers, and having read between\\ntheir lines long enough, i now\\nsay to myself that the greater part of\\nconscious thinking must be\\ncounted among the instinctive functions, and\\nit is so even in the case\\nof philosophical thinking; one has here to\\nlearn anew, as one learned\\nanew about heredity and \"innateness.\"  as\\nlittle as the act of birth\\ncomes into consideration in the whole process\\nand procedure of\\nheredity, just as little is \"being-conscious\" opposed\\nto the\\ninstinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the\\nconscious\\nthinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his\\ninstincts, and\\nforced into definite channels.  and behind all logic and\\nits seeming\\nsovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak\\nmore\\nplainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite\\nmode\\nof life for example, that the certain is worth more than the\\nuncertain, that illusion is less valuable than \"truth\" such\\nvaluations,\\nin spite of their regulative importance for us, might\\nnotwithstanding be\\nonly superficial valuations, special kinds of\\n_niaiserie_, such as may\\nbe necessary for the maintenance of beings\\nsuch as ourselves.  supposing,\\nin effect, that man is not just the\\n\"measure of things.\"\\n\\n4. the falseness of an opinion is not for us any\\nobjection to it: it is\\nhere, perhaps, that our new language sounds\\nmost strangely.  the\\nquestion is, how far an opinion is life-\\nfurthering, life-preserving,\\nspecies-preserving, perhaps species-\\nrearing, and we are fundamentally\\ninclined to maintain that the\\nfalsest opinions (to which the synthetic\\njudgments a priori belong),\\nare the most indispensable to us, that\\nwithout a recognition of\\nlogical fictions, without a comparison of\\nreality with the purely\\nimagined world of the absolute and immutable,\\nwithout a constant\\ncounterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,\\nman could not live--\\nthat the renunciation of false opinions would be\\na renunciation of\\nlife, a negation of life.  to recognise untruth as a\\ncondition of\\nlife; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of\\nvalue in a\\ndangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,\\nhas\\nthereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.\\n\\n5. that which\\ncauses philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully\\nand half-\\nmockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they\\nare--\\nhow often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in\\nshort,\\nhow childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not\\nenough\\nhonest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and\\nvirtuous\\noutcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in\\nthe\\nremotest manner.  they all pose as though their real opinions had\\nbeen\\ndiscovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,\\ndivinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,\\nwho, fairer and foolisher, talk of \"inspiration\"), whereas, in fact, a\\nprejudiced proposition, idea, or \"suggestion,\" which is generally\\ntheir heart\\'s desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with\\narguments sought out after the event.  they are all advocates who do\\nnot\\nwish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of\\ntheir\\nprejudices, which they dub \"truths,\"--and very far from having\\nthe\\nconscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from\\nhaving\\nthe good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this\\nbe\\nunderstood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful\\nconfidence\\nand self-ridicule.  the spectacle of the tartuffery of old\\nkant, equally\\nstiff and decent, with which he entices us into the\\ndialectic\\nby-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his\\n\"categorical\\nimperative\"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find\\nno small\\namusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists\\nand ethical\\npreachers.  or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in\\nmathematical form, by\\nmeans of which spinoza has, as it were, clad his\\nphilosophy in mail and\\nmask--in fact, the \"love of his wisdom,\" to\\ntranslate the term fairly\\nand squarely--in order thereby to strike\\nterror at once into the heart\\nof the assailant who should dare to cast\\na glance on that invincible\\nmaiden, that pallas athene:--how much of\\npersonal timidity and\\nvulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly\\nrecluse betray!\\n\\n6. it has gradually become clear to me what every\\ngreat philosophy up\\ntill now has consisted of--namely, the confession\\nof its originator, and\\na species of involuntary and unconscious auto-\\nbiography; and moreover\\nthat the moral (or immoral) purpose in every\\nphilosophy has constituted\\nthe true vital germ out of which the entire\\nplant has always grown.\\nindeed, to understand how the abstrusest\\nmetaphysical assertions of a\\nphilosopher have been arrived at, it is\\nalways well (and wise) to first\\nask oneself: \"what morality do they\\n(or does he) aim at?\"  accordingly,\\ni do not believe that an \"impulse\\nto knowledge\" is the father of\\nphilosophy; but that another impulse,\\nhere as elsewhere, has only made\\nuse of knowledge (and mistaken\\nknowledge!) as an instrument.  but whoever\\nconsiders the fundamental\\nimpulses of man with a view to determining\\nhow far they may have here\\nacted as inspiring genii (or as demons and\\ncobolds), will find that\\nthey have all practiced philosophy at one time\\nor another, and that\\neach one of them would have been only too glad to\\nlook upon itself as\\nthe ultimate end of existence and the legitimate\\nlord over all the\\nother impulses.  for every impulse is imperious, and as\\nsuch, attempts\\nto philosophize.  to be sure, in the case of scholars, in\\nthe case of\\nreally scientific men, it may be otherwise--\"better,\" if\\nyou will;\\nthere there may really be such a thing as an \"impulse to\\nknowledge,\"\\nsome kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well\\nwound up,\\nworks away industriously to that end, without the rest of\\nthe\\nscholarly impulses taking any material part therein.  the actual\\n\"interests\" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another\\ndirection--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;\\nit is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his\\nlittle\\nmachine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes\\na\\ngood philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not\\ncharacterised by becoming this or that.  in the philosopher, on the\\ncontrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,\\nhis\\nmorality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he\\nis,--\\nthat is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature\\nstand\\nto each other.\\n\\n7. how malicious philosophers can be!  i know of\\nnothing more stinging\\nthan the joke epicurus took the liberty of\\nmaking on plato and the\\nplatonists; he called them dionysiokolakes.\\nin its original sense,\\nand on the face of it, the word signifies\\n\"flatterers of\\ndionysius\"--consequently, tyrants\\' accessories and\\nlick-spittles;\\nbesides this, however, it is as much as to say, \"they\\nare all actors,\\nthere is nothing genuine about them\" (for\\ndionysiokolax was a popular\\nname for an actor). and the latter is\\nreally the malignant reproach that\\nepicurus cast upon plato: he was\\nannoyed by the grandiose manner, the\\nmise en scene style of which\\nplato and his scholars were masters--of\\nwhich epicurus was not a\\nmaster!  he, the old school-teacher of samos,\\nwho sat concealed in his\\nlittle garden at athens, and wrote three\\nhundred books, perhaps out of\\nrage and ambitious envy of plato, who\\nknows!  greece took a hundred\\nyears to find out who the garden-god\\nepicurus really was.  did she\\never find out?\\n\\n8. there is a point in every philosophy at which the\\n\"conviction\" of\\nthe philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in\\nthe words of an\\nancient mystery:\\n\\nadventavit asinus, pulcher et\\nfortissimus.\\n\\n9. you desire to live \"according to nature\"? oh, you\\nnoble stoics, what\\nfraud of words!  imagine to yourselves a being like\\nnature, boundlessly\\nextravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without\\npurpose or consideration,\\nwithout pity or justice, at once fruitful\\nand barren and uncertain:\\nimagine to yourselves indifference as a\\npower--how could you live\\nin accordance with such indifference?  to\\nlive--is not that just\\nendeavouring to be otherwise than this nature?\\nis not living valuing,\\npreferring, being unjust, being limited,\\nendeavouring to be different?\\nand granted that your imperative,\\n\"living according to nature,\" means\\nactually the same as \"living\\naccording to life\"--how could you do\\ndifferently?  why should you make\\na principle out of what you yourselves\\nare, and must be?  in reality,\\nhowever, it is quite otherwise with you:\\nwhile you pretend to read\\nwith rapture the canon of your law in nature,\\nyou want something quite\\nthe contrary, you extraordinary stage-players\\nand self-deluders!  in\\nyour pride you wish to dictate your morals and\\nideals to nature, to\\nnature herself, and to incorporate them therein;\\nyou insist that it\\nshall be nature \"according to the stoa,\" and would\\nlike everything to\\nbe made after your own image, as a vast, eternal\\nglorification and\\ngeneralism of stoicism!  with all your love for truth,\\nyou have forced\\nyourselves so long, so persistently, and with such\\nhypnotic rigidity\\nto see nature falsely, that is to say, stoically,\\nthat you are no\\nlonger able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some\\nunfathomable\\nsuperciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope that\\nbecause you are\\nable to tyrannize over yourselves--stoicism is\\nself-tyranny--nature\\nwill also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is\\nnot the stoic a part\\nof nature?... but this is an old and everlasting\\nstory: what happened\\nin old times with the stoics still happens today,\\nas soon as ever a\\nphilosophy begins to believe in itself.  it always\\ncreates the world\\nin its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy\\nis this\\ntyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual will to power, the\\nwill\\nto \"creation of the world,\" the will to the causa prima.\\n\\n10. the\\neagerness and subtlety, i should even say craftiness, with\\nwhich the\\nproblem of \"the real and the apparent world\" is dealt with at\\npresent\\nthroughout europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and\\nhe\\nwho hears only a \"will to truth\" in the background, and nothing else,\\ncannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears.  in rare and isolated\\ncases, it may really have happened that such a will to truth--a\\ncertain\\nextravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician\\'s ambition\\nof the\\nforlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end\\nalways\\nprefers a handful of \"certainty\" to a whole cartload of\\nbeautiful\\npossibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of\\nconscience,\\nwho prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing,\\nrather than in an\\nuncertain something.  but that is nihilism, and the\\nsign of a despairing,\\nmortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the\\ncourageous bearing such a\\nvirtue may display.  it seems, however, to\\nbe otherwise with stronger\\nand livelier thinkers who are still eager\\nfor life.  in that they side\\nagainst appearance, and speak\\nsuperciliously of \"perspective,\" in\\nthat they rank the credibility of\\ntheir own bodies about as low as the\\ncredibility of the ocular\\nevidence that \"the earth stands still,\" and\\nthus, apparently, allowing\\nwith complacency their securest possession\\nto escape (for what does\\none at present believe in more firmly than\\nin one\\'s body?),--who knows\\nif they are not really trying to win back\\nsomething which was formerly\\nan even securer possession, something\\nof the old domain of the faith\\nof former times, perhaps the \"immortal\\nsoul,\" perhaps \"the old god,\"\\nin short, ideas by which they could live\\nbetter, that is to say, more\\nvigorously and more joyously, than by\\n\"modern ideas\"? there is\\ndistrust of these modern ideas in this mode\\nof looking at things, a\\ndisbelief in all that has been constructed\\nyesterday and today; there\\nis perhaps some slight admixture of satiety\\nand scorn, which can no\\nlonger endure the bric-a-brac of ideas of the\\nmost varied origin, such\\nas so-called positivism at present throws on\\nthe market; a disgust of\\nthe more refined taste at the village-fair\\nmotleyness and patchiness\\nof all these reality-philosophasters, in whom\\nthere is nothing either\\nnew or true, except this motleyness.  therein it\\nseems to me that we\\nshould agree with those skeptical anti-realists and\\nknowledge-\\nmicroscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels\\nthem\\nfrom modern reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde\\nby-paths\\nconcern us!  the main thing about them is not that they wish\\nto go\\n\"back,\" but that they wish to get away therefrom.  a little more\\nstrength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be off--\\nand\\nnot back!\\n\\n11. it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt\\nat present to\\ndivert attention from the actual influence which kant\\nexercised on\\ngerman philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the\\nvalue which\\nhe set upon himself.  kant was first and foremost proud of\\nhis table of\\ncategories; with it in his hand he said: \"this is the\\nmost difficult\\nthing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of\\nmetaphysics.\"  let us\\nonly understand this \"could be\"! he was proud of\\nhaving discovered a\\nnew faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic\\njudgment a priori.  granting\\nthat he deceived himself in this matter;\\nthe development and rapid\\nflourishing of german philosophy depended\\nnevertheless on his pride, and\\non the eager rivalry of the younger\\ngeneration to discover if possible\\nsomething--at all events \"new\\nfaculties\"--of which to be still\\nprouder!--but let us reflect for a\\nmoment--it is high time to do so.\\n\"how are synthetic judgments a\\npriori possible?\"  kant asks himself--and\\nwhat is really his answer?\\n\"by means of a means (faculty)\"--but\\nunfortunately not in five words,\\nbut so circumstantially, imposingly,\\nand with such display of german\\nprofundity and verbal flourishes, that\\none altogether loses sight of\\nthe comical niaiserie allemande involved\\nin such an answer.  people\\nwere beside themselves with delight over this\\nnew faculty, and the\\njubilation reached its climax when kant further\\ndiscovered a moral\\nfaculty in man--for at that time germans were still\\nmoral, not yet\\ndabbling in the \"politics of hard fact.\"  then came\\nthe honeymoon of\\ngerman philosophy.  all the young theologians of the\\ntubingen\\ninstitution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for\\n\"faculties.\"  and what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and\\nstill youthful period of the german spirit, to which romanticism, the\\nmalicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish\\nbetween \"finding\" and \"inventing\"! above all a faculty for the\\n\"transcendental\"; schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,\\nand\\nthereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally\\npious-\\ninclined germans.  one can do no greater wrong to the whole of\\nthis\\nexuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,\\nnotwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and\\nsenile\\nconceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with\\nmoral\\nindignation.  enough, however--the world grew older, and the\\ndream\\nvanished.  a time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and\\nthey still\\nrub them today.  people had been dreaming, and first and\\nforemost--old\\nkant.  \"by means of a means (faculty)\"--he had said, or\\nat least meant to\\nsay.  but, is that--an answer?  an explanation?  or\\nis it not rather merely\\na repetition of the question?  how does opium\\ninduce sleep?  \"by means of\\na means (faculty),\" namely the virtus\\ndormitiva, replies the doctor in\\nmoliere,\\n\\n    quia est in eo virtus\\ndormitiva,\\n    cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\\n\\nbut such replies\\nbelong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time\\nto replace the\\nkantian question, \"how are synthetic judgments a priori\\npossible?\"  by\\nanother question, \"why is belief in such judgments\\nnecessary?\"--in\\neffect, it is high time that we should understand\\nthat such judgments\\nmust be believed to be true, for the sake of the\\npreservation of\\ncreatures like ourselves; though they still might\\nnaturally be false\\njudgments!  or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and\\nreadily--\\nsynthetic judgments a priori should not \"be possible\" at all;\\nwe have\\nno right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false\\njudgments.\\nonly, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as\\nplausible\\nbelief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view\\nof life.\\nand finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which\\n\"german\\nphilosophy\"--i hope you understand its right to inverted commas\\n(goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of europe, there is\\nno doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to\\ngerman philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,\\nthe mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths christians, and the\\npolitical obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the\\nstill\\noverwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century\\ninto\\nthis, in short--\"sensus assoupire.\"...\\n\\n12. as regards\\nmaterialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted\\ntheories that\\nhave been advanced, and in europe there is now perhaps\\nno one in the\\nlearned world so unscholarly as to attach serious\\nsignification to it,\\nexcept for convenient everyday use (as an\\nabbreviation of the means of\\nexpression)--thanks chiefly to the pole\\nboscovich: he and the pole\\ncopernicus have hitherto been the greatest\\nand most successful\\nopponents of ocular evidence.  for while copernicus\\nhas persuaded us\\nto believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth\\ndoes not stand\\nfast, boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the\\nlast thing\\nthat \"stood fast\" of the earth--the belief in \"substance,\" in\\n\"matter,\" in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest\\ntriumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth.  one\\nmust, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war\\nto the knife, against the \"atomistic requirements\" which still lead a\\ndangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the\\nmore\\ncelebrated \"metaphysical requirements\": one must also above all\\ngive\\nthe finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism\\nwhich\\nchristianity has taught best and longest, the soul-atomism.  let\\nit be\\npermitted to designate by this expression the belief which\\nregards the\\nsoul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as\\na monad,\\nas an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science!\\nbetween\\nourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of \"the soul\"\\nthereby,\\nand thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated\\nhypotheses--as\\nhappens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists,\\nwho can hardly\\ntouch on the soul without immediately losing it.  but\\nthe way is open\\nfor new acceptations and refinements of the soul-\\nhypothesis; and such\\nconceptions as \"mortal soul,\" and \"soul of\\nsubjective multiplicity,\"\\nand \"soul as social structure of the\\ninstincts and passions,\" want\\nhenceforth to have legitimate rights in\\nscience.  in that the new\\npsychologist is about to put an end to the\\nsuperstitions which have\\nhitherto flourished with almost tropical\\nluxuriance around the idea of\\nthe soul, he is really, as it were,\\nthrusting himself into a new desert\\nand a new distrust--it is possible\\nthat the older psychologists had a\\nmerrier and more comfortable time\\nof it; eventually, however, he finds\\nthat precisely thereby he is also\\ncondemned to invent--and, who knows?\\nperhaps to discover the new.\\n\\n13.\\npsychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the\\ninstinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic\\nbeing.  a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength--life\\nitself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect\\nand most frequent results thereof.  in short, here, as everywhere\\nelse,\\nlet us beware of superfluous teleological principles!--one of\\nwhich\\nis the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to spinoza\\'s\\ninconsistency). it is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must\\nbe essentially economy of principles.\\n\\n14. it is perhaps just dawning\\non five or six minds that natural\\nphilosophy is only a world-\\nexposition and world-arrangement (according\\nto us, if i may say so!)\\nand not a world-explanation; but in so far as\\nit is based on belief in\\nthe senses, it is regarded as more, and for a\\nlong time to come must\\nbe regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.\\nit has eyes and\\nfingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and\\npalpableness of its\\nown: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and\\nconvincingly upon\\nan age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it\\nfollows\\ninstinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.\\nwhat\\nis clear, what is \"explained\"? only that which can be seen and\\nfelt--\\none must pursue every problem thus far.  obversely, however, the\\ncharm\\nof the platonic mode of thought, which was an aristocratic mode,\\nconsisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps\\namong men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than\\nour\\ncontemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in\\nremaining\\nmasters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey\\nconceptional\\nnetworks which they threw over the motley whirl of the\\nsenses--the\\nmob of the senses, as plato said.  in this overcoming of\\nthe world, and\\ninterpreting of the world in the manner of plato, there\\nwas an enjoyment\\ndifferent from that which the physicists of today\\noffer us--and likewise\\nthe darwinists and anti-teleologists among the\\nphysiological workers,\\nwith their principle of the \"smallest possible\\neffort,\" and the greatest\\npossible blunder.  \"where there is nothing\\nmore to see or to grasp, there\\nis also nothing more for men to do\"--\\nthat is certainly an imperative\\ndifferent from the platonic one, but\\nit may notwithstanding be the right\\nimperative for a hardy, laborious\\nrace of machinists and bridge-builders\\nof the future, who have nothing\\nbut rough work to perform.\\n\\n15. to study physiology with a clear\\nconscience, one must insist on\\nthe fact that the sense-organs are not\\nphenomena in the sense of the\\nidealistic philosophy; as such they\\ncertainly could not be causes!\\nsensualism, therefore, at least as\\nregulative hypothesis, if not as\\nheuristic principle.  what?  and\\nothers say even that the external world\\nis the work of our organs?\\nbut then our body, as a part of this external\\nworld, would be the work\\nof our organs!  but then our organs themselves\\nwould be the work of\\nour organs!  it seems to me that this is a\\ncomplete reductio ad\\nabsurdum, if the conception causa sui is something\\nfundamentally\\nabsurd.  consequently, the external world is not the work\\nof our\\norgans--?\\n\\n16. there are still harmless self-observers who believe\\nthat there are\\n\"immediate certainties\"; for instance, \"i think,\" or as\\nthe superstition\\nof schopenhauer puts it, \"i will\"; as though\\ncognition here got hold\\nof its object purely and simply as \"the thing\\nin itself,\" without any\\nfalsification taking place either on the part\\nof the subject or the\\nobject.  i would repeat it, however, a hundred\\ntimes, that \"immediate\\ncertainty,\" as well as \"absolute knowledge\" and\\nthe \"thing in itself,\"\\ninvolve a contradictio in adjecto; we really\\nought to free ourselves\\nfrom the misleading significance of words!\\nthe people on their part may\\nthink that cognition is knowing all about\\nthings, but the philosopher\\nmust say to himself: \"when i analyze the\\nprocess that is expressed in\\nthe sentence, \\'i think,\\' i find a whole\\nseries of daring assertions, the\\nargumentative proof of which would be\\ndifficult, perhaps impossible:\\nfor instance, that it is _i_ who think,\\nthat there must necessarily be\\nsomething that thinks, that thinking is\\nan activity and operation on the\\npart of a being who is thought of as\\na cause, that there is an \\'ego,\\'\\nand finally, that it is already\\ndetermined what is to be designated by\\nthinking--that i know what\\nthinking is.  for if i had not already decided\\nwithin myself what it\\nis, by what standard could i determine whether\\nthat which is just\\nhappening is not perhaps \\'willing\\' or \\'feeling\\'? in\\nshort, the\\nassertion \\'i think,\\' assumes that i compare my state at the\\npresent\\nmoment with other states of myself which i know, in order to\\ndetermine\\nwhat it is; on account of this retrospective connection with\\nfurther\\n\\'knowledge,\\' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for\\nme.\"--in\\nplace of the \"immediate certainty\" in which the people may\\nbelieve in\\nthe special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of\\nmetaphysical\\nquestions presented to him, veritable conscience questions\\nof the\\nintellect, to wit: \"whence did i get the notion of \\'thinking\\'?\\nwhy do\\ni believe in cause and effect?  what gives me the right to speak\\nof an\\n\\'ego,\\' and even of an \\'ego\\' as cause, and finally of an \\'ego\\'\\nas cause\\nof thought?\"  he who ventures to answer these metaphysical\\nquestions\\nat once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception, like\\nthe\\nperson who says, \"i think, and know that this, at least, is\\ntrue,\\nactual, and certain\"--will encounter a smile and two notes of\\ninterrogation in a philosopher nowadays.  \"sir,\" the philosopher will\\nperhaps give him to understand, \"it is improbable that you are not\\nmistaken, but why should it be the truth?\"\\n\\n17. with regard to the\\nsuperstitions of logicians, i shall never tire\\nof emphasizing a small,\\nterse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by\\nthese credulous minds--\\nnamely, that a thought comes when \"it\" wishes,\\nand not when \"i\" wish;\\nso that it is a perversion of the facts of the\\ncase to say that the\\nsubject \"i\" is the condition of the predicate\\n\"think.\"  one thinks;\\nbut that this \"one\" is precisely the famous old\\n\"ego,\" is, to put it\\nmildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and\\nassuredly not an\\n\"immediate certainty.\"  after all, one has even gone too\\nfar with this\\n\"one thinks\"--even the \"one\" contains an interpretation of\\nthe\\nprocess, and does not belong to the process itself.  one infers here\\naccording to the usual grammatical formula--\"to think is an activity;\\nevery activity requires an agency that is active; consequently\"... it\\nwas pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought,\\nbesides\\nthe operating \"power,\" the material particle wherein it\\nresides and out\\nof which it operates--the atom.  more rigorous minds,\\nhowever, learnt at\\nlast to get along without this \"earth-residuum,\"\\nand perhaps some day we\\nshall accustom ourselves, even from the\\nlogician\\'s point of view, to\\nget along without the little \"one\" (to\\nwhich the worthy old \"ego\" has\\nrefined itself).\\n\\n18. it is certainly\\nnot the least charm of a theory that it is\\nrefutable; it is precisely\\nthereby that it attracts the more subtle\\nminds.  it seems that the\\nhundred-times-refuted theory of the \"free will\"\\nowes its persistence\\nto this charm alone; some one is always appearing\\nwho feels himself\\nstrong enough to refute it.\\n\\n19. philosophers are accustomed to speak\\nof the will as though it were\\nthe best-known thing in the world;\\nindeed, schopenhauer has given us\\nto understand that the will alone is\\nreally known to us, absolutely and\\ncompletely known, without deduction\\nor addition.  but it again and\\nagain seems to me that in this case\\nschopenhauer also only did what\\nphilosophers are in the habit of doing\\n--he seems to have adopted a\\npopular prejudice and exaggerated it.\\nwilling seems to me to be above\\nall something complicated, something\\nthat is a unity only in name--and\\nit is precisely in a name that\\npopular prejudice lurks, which has got\\nthe mastery over the inadequate\\nprecautions of philosophers in all ages.\\nso let us for once be more\\ncautious, let us be \"unphilosophical\": let\\nus say that in all willing\\nthere is firstly a plurality of sensations,\\nnamely, the sensation of\\nthe condition \"away from which we go,\" the\\nsensation of the condition\\n\"towards which we go,\" the sensation of this\\n\"from\" and \"towards\"\\nitself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular\\nsensation, which,\\neven without our putting in motion \"arms and legs,\"\\ncommences its\\naction by force of habit, directly we \"will\" anything.\\ntherefore, just\\nas sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are\\nto be\\nrecognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,\\nthinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is\\na\\nruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this\\nthought from the \"willing,\" as if the will would then remain over!\\nin\\nthe third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and\\nthinking, but it is above all an emotion, and in fact the emotion of\\nthe\\ncommand.  that which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is\\nessentially the\\nemotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey:\\n\"i am free, \\'he\\'\\nmust obey\"--this consciousness is inherent in every\\nwill; and equally\\nso the straining of the attention, the straight look\\nwhich fixes itself\\nexclusively on one thing, the unconditional\\njudgment that \"this and\\nnothing else is necessary now,\" the inward\\ncertainty that obedience\\nwill be rendered--and whatever else pertains\\nto the position of the\\ncommander.  a man who wills commands something\\nwithin himself which\\nrenders obedience, or which he believes renders\\nobedience.  but now let\\nus notice what is the strangest thing about\\nthe will,--this affair so\\nextremely complex, for which the people have\\nonly one name.  inasmuch as\\nin the given circumstances we are at the\\nsame time the commanding and\\nthe obeying parties, and as the obeying\\nparty we know the sensations of\\nconstraint, impulsion, pressure,\\nresistance, and motion, which usually\\ncommence immediately after the\\nact of will; inasmuch as, on the other\\nhand, we are accustomed to\\ndisregard this duality, and to deceive\\nourselves about it by means of\\nthe synthetic term \"i\": a whole series\\nof erroneous conclusions, and\\nconsequently of false judgments about the\\nwill itself, has become\\nattached to the act of willing--to such a degree\\nthat he who wills\\nbelieves firmly that willing suffices for action.\\nsince in the\\nmajority of cases there has only been exercise of will\\nwhen the effect\\nof the command--consequently obedience, and therefore\\naction--was to\\nbe expected, the appearance has translated itself into\\nthe sentiment,\\nas if there were a necessity of effect; in a word, he who\\nwills\\nbelieves with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are\\nsomehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing,\\nto the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation\\nof\\npower which accompanies all success.  \"freedom of will\"--that is the\\nexpression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising\\nvolition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with\\nthe executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over\\nobstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will\\nthat overcame them.  in this way the person exercising volition adds\\nthe\\nfeelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the\\nuseful\\n\"underwills\" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social\\nstructure\\ncomposed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as\\ncommander.  l\\'effet\\nc\\'est moi.  what happens here is what happens in\\nevery well-constructed\\nand happy commonwealth, namely, that the\\ngoverning class identifies\\nitself with the successes of the\\ncommonwealth.  in all willing it is\\nabsolutely a question of\\ncommanding and obeying, on the basis, as\\nalready said, of a social\\nstructure composed of many \"souls\", on which\\naccount a philosopher\\nshould claim the right to include willing-as-such\\nwithin the sphere of\\nmorals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations\\nof supremacy under\\nwhich the phenomenon of \"life\" manifests itself.\\n\\n20. that the\\nseparate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or\\nautonomously\\nevolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with\\neach other,\\nthat, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear\\nin the\\nhistory of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to\\na system\\nas the collective members of the fauna of a continent--is\\nbetrayed in\\nthe end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most\\ndiverse\\nphilosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme\\nof\\npossible philosophies.  under an invisible spell, they always revolve\\nonce more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they\\nmay feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something\\nwithin them leads them, something impels them in definite order the\\none after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship\\nof their ideas.  their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than\\na\\nre-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-\\noff,\\nancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas\\nformerly\\ngrew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the\\nhighest order.\\nthe wonderful family resemblance of all indian, greek,\\nand german\\nphilosophizing is easily enough explained.  in fact, where\\nthere is\\naffinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of\\ngrammar--i mean\\nowing to the unconscious domination and guidance of\\nsimilar grammatical\\nfunctions--it cannot but be that everything is\\nprepared at the outset\\nfor a similar development and succession of\\nphilosophical systems,\\njust as the way seems barred against certain\\nother possibilities of\\nworld-interpretation.  it is highly probable\\nthat philosophers within the\\ndomain of the ural-altaic languages\\n(where the conception of the subject\\nis least developed) look\\notherwise \"into the world,\" and will be\\nfound on paths of thought\\ndifferent from those of the indo-germans and\\nmussulmans, the spell of\\ncertain grammatical functions is ultimately\\nalso the spell of\\nphysiological valuations and racial conditions.--so\\nmuch by way of\\nrejecting locke\\'s superficiality with regard to the\\norigin of ideas.\\n21. the causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has yet been\\nconceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but\\nthe\\nextravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly\\nand\\nfrightfully with this very folly.  the desire for \"freedom of\\nwill\"\\nin the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds\\nsway,\\nunfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to\\nbear\\nthe entire and ultimate responsibility for one\\'s actions oneself,\\nand\\nto absolve god, the world, ancestors, chance, and society\\ntherefrom,\\ninvolves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui,\\nand, with\\nmore than munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into\\nexistence by the\\nhair, out of the slough of nothingness.  if any one\\nshould find out in\\nthis manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated\\nconception of \"free\\nwill\" and put it out of his head altogether, i beg\\nof him to carry\\nhis \"enlightenment\" a step further, and also put out\\nof his head the\\ncontrary of this monstrous conception of \"free will\":\\ni mean \"non-free\\nwill,\" which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and\\neffect.  one\\nshould not wrongly materialise \"cause\" and \"effect,\" as\\nthe natural\\nphilosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in\\nthinking at\\npresent), according to the prevailing mechanical\\ndoltishness which makes\\nthe cause press and push until it \"effects\"\\nits end; one should use\\n\"cause\" and \"effect\" only as pure conceptions,\\nthat is to say, as\\nconventional fictions for the purpose of\\ndesignation and mutual\\nunderstanding,--not for explanation.  in\\n\"being-in-itself\" there is\\nnothing of \"casual-connection,\" of\\n\"necessity,\" or of \"psychological\\nnon-freedom\"; there the effect does\\nnot follow the cause, there \"law\"\\ndoes not obtain.  it is we alone who\\nhave devised cause, sequence,\\nreciprocity, relativity, constraint,\\nnumber, law, freedom, motive,\\nand purpose; and when we interpret and\\nintermix this symbol-world,\\nas \"being-in-itself,\" with things, we act\\nonce more as we have always\\nacted--mythologically.  the \"non-free\\nwill\" is mythology; in real life\\nit is only a question of strong and\\nweak wills.--it is almost always\\na symptom of what is lacking in\\nhimself, when a thinker, in every\\n\"causal-connection\" and\\n\"psychological necessity,\" manifests something\\nof compulsion,\\nindigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;\\nit is\\nsuspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself.  and\\nin\\ngeneral, if i have observed correctly, the \"non-freedom of the will\"\\nis regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but\\nalways in a profoundly personal manner: some will not give up their\\n\"responsibility,\" their belief in themselves, the personal right to\\ntheir merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class);\\nothers\\non the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or\\nblamed\\nfor anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to get\\nout of\\nthe business, no matter how.  the latter, when they write\\nbooks, are\\nin the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a\\nsort of\\nsocialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise.  and as a\\nmatter of\\nfact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself\\nsurprisingly\\nwhen it can pose as \"la religion de la souffrance\\nhumaine\"; that is its\\n\"good taste.\"\\n\\n22. let me be pardoned, as an old\\nphilologist who cannot desist from\\nthe mischief of putting his finger\\non bad modes of interpretation, but\\n\"nature\\'s conformity to law,\" of\\nwhich you physicists talk so proudly,\\nas though--why, it exists only\\nowing to your interpretation and bad\\n\"philology.\"  it is no matter of\\nfact, no \"text,\" but rather just a\\nnaively humanitarian adjustment and\\nperversion of meaning, with which\\nyou make abundant concessions to the\\ndemocratic instincts of the modern\\nsoul!  \"everywhere equality before\\nthe law--nature is not different in\\nthat respect, nor better than we\":\\na fine instance of secret motive,\\nin which the vulgar antagonism to\\neverything privileged and\\nautocratic--likewise a second and more\\nrefined atheism--is once more\\ndisguised.  \"ni dieu, ni maitre\"--that,\\nalso, is what you want; and\\ntherefore \"cheers for natural law!\"--is it\\nnot so?  but, as has been\\nsaid, that is interpretation, not text; and\\nsomebody might come along,\\nwho, with opposite intentions and modes of\\ninterpretation, could read\\nout of the same \"nature,\" and with regard\\nto the same phenomena, just\\nthe tyrannically inconsiderate and\\nrelentless enforcement of the claims\\nof power--an interpreter who\\nshould so place the unexceptionalness and\\nunconditionalness of all\\n\"will to power\" before your eyes, that almost\\nevery word, and the word\\n\"tyranny\" itself, would eventually seem\\nunsuitable, or like a\\nweakening and softening metaphor--as being too\\nhuman; and who should,\\nnevertheless, end by asserting the same about\\nthis world as you do,\\nnamely, that it has a \"necessary\" and \"calculable\"\\ncourse, not,\\nhowever, because laws obtain in it, but because they are\\nabsolutely\\nlacking, and every power effects its ultimate consequences\\nevery\\nmoment.  granted that this also is only interpretation--and you\\nwill\\nbe eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.\\n23. all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and\\ntimidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths.  in so far\\nas it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been\\nwritten,\\nevidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it\\nseems as if\\nnobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the\\nmorphology\\nand development-doctrine of the will to power, as i\\nconceive of it.\\nthe power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply\\ninto the most\\nintellectual world, the world apparently most\\nindifferent and\\nunprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an\\ninjurious, obstructive,\\nblinding, and distorting manner.  a proper\\nphysio-psychology has to\\ncontend with unconscious antagonism in the\\nheart of the investigator,\\nit has \"the heart\" against it even a\\ndoctrine of the reciprocal\\nconditionalness of the \"good\" and the \"bad\"\\nimpulses, causes (as\\nrefined immorality) distress and aversion in a\\nstill strong and manly\\nconscience--still more so, a doctrine of the\\nderivation of all good\\nimpulses from bad ones.  if, however, a person\\nshould regard even\\nthe emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and\\nimperiousness\\nas life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be\\npresent,\\nfundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life\\n(which\\nmust, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further\\ndeveloped), he will suffer from such a view of things as from\\nsea-\\nsickness.  and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest\\nand\\nmost painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous\\nknowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one\\nshould keep away from it who can do so!  on the other hand, if one has\\nonce drifted hither with one\\'s bark, well!  very good!  now let us set\\nour\\nteeth firmly!  let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the\\nhelm!\\nwe sail away right over morality, we crush out, we destroy\\nperhaps the\\nremains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage\\nthither--but\\nwhat do we matter.  never yet did a profounder world of\\ninsight reveal\\nitself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the\\npsychologist who\\nthus \"makes a sacrifice\"--it is not the sacrifizio\\ndell\\' intelletto,\\non the contrary!--will at least be entitled to\\ndemand in return that\\npsychology shall once more be recognized as the\\nqueen of the sciences,\\nfor whose service and equipment the other\\nsciences exist.  for psychology\\nis once more the path to the\\nfundamental problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii.  the free spirit\\n\\n\\n24. o sancta\\nsimplicitiatas!  in what strange simplification and\\nfalsification man\\nlives!  one can never cease wondering when once one has\\ngot eyes for\\nbeholding this marvel!  how we have made everything around\\nus clear\\nand free and easy and simple!  how we have been able to give\\nour\\nsenses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike\\ndesire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the\\nbeginning,\\nwe have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy\\nan almost\\ninconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence,\\nheartiness,\\nand gaiety--in order to enjoy life!  and only on this\\nsolidified,\\ngranite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear\\nitself\\nhitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more\\npowerful\\nwill, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue!\\nnot as\\nits opposite, but--as its refinement!  it is to be hoped,\\nindeed, that\\nlanguage, here as elsewhere, will not get over its\\nawkwardness, and that\\nit will continue to talk of opposites where\\nthere are only degrees\\nand many refinements of gradation; it is\\nequally to be hoped that the\\nincarnated tartuffery of morals, which\\nnow belongs to our unconquerable\\n\"flesh and blood,\" will turn the\\nwords round in the mouths of us\\ndiscerning ones.  here and there we\\nunderstand it, and laugh at the way\\nin which precisely the best\\nknowledge seeks most to retain us in this\\nsimplified, thoroughly\\nartificial, suitably imagined, and suitably\\nfalsified world: at the\\nway in which, whether it will or not, it loves\\nerror, because, as\\nliving itself, it loves life!\\n\\n25. after such a cheerful commencement,\\na serious word would fain be\\nheard; it appeals to the most serious\\nminds.  take care, ye philosophers\\nand friends of knowledge, and\\nbeware of martyrdom!  of suffering \"for the\\ntruth\\'s sake\"! even in\\nyour own defense!  it spoils all the innocence\\nand fine neutrality of\\nyour conscience; it makes you headstrong against\\nobjections and red\\nrags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when\\nin the struggle\\nwith danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even\\nworse\\nconsequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card\\nas\\nprotectors of truth upon earth--as though \"the truth\" were such an\\ninnocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors!  and you\\nof\\nall people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, messrs loafers\\nand\\ncobweb-spinners of the spirit!  finally, ye know sufficiently well\\nthat\\nit cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point; ye\\nknow\\nthat hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that\\nthere might\\nbe a more laudable truthfulness in every little\\ninterrogative mark\\nwhich you place after your special words and\\nfavourite doctrines (and\\noccasionally after yourselves) than in all\\nthe solemn pantomime and\\ntrumping games before accusers and law-\\ncourts!  rather go out of the way!\\nflee into concealment!  and have\\nyour masks and your ruses, that ye may\\nbe mistaken for what you are,\\nor somewhat feared!  and pray, don\\'t forget\\nthe garden, the garden\\nwith golden trellis-work!  and have people around\\nyou who are as a\\ngarden--or as music on the waters at eventide, when\\nalready the day\\nbecomes a memory.  choose the good solitude, the free,\\nwanton,\\nlightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to\\nremain\\ngood in any sense whatsoever!  how poisonous, how crafty, how bad,\\ndoes every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means\\nof\\nforce!  how personal does a long fear make one, a long watching\\nof\\nenemies, of possible enemies!  these pariahs of society, these\\nlong-\\npursued, badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses, the\\nspinozas or giordano brunos--always become in the end, even under the\\nmost intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves\\naware\\nof it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers (just lay\\nbare\\nthe foundation of spinoza\\'s ethics and theology!), not to speak\\nof\\nthe stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in\\na\\nphilosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him.\\nthe\\nmartyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the sake of\\ntruth,\"\\nforces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks\\nin him;\\nand if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic\\ncuriosity,\\nwith regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand\\nthe dangerous\\ndesire to see him also in his deterioration\\n(deteriorated into a\\n\"martyr,\" into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). only,\\nthat it is necessary\\nwith such a desire to be clear what spectacle one\\nwill see in any\\ncase--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce,\\nmerely the\\ncontinued proof that the long, real tragedy is at an end,\\nsupposing that\\nevery philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.\\n26. every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a\\nprivacy,\\nwhere he is free from the crowd, the many, the majority--\\nwhere he may\\nforget \"men who are the rule,\" as their\\nexception;--exclusive only of\\nthe case in which he is pushed straight\\nto such men by a still stronger\\ninstinct, as a discerner in the great\\nand exceptional sense.  whoever, in\\nintercourse with men, does not\\noccasionally glisten in all the green\\nand grey colours of distress,\\nowing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,\\ngloominess, and solitariness, is\\nassuredly not a man of elevated tastes;\\nsupposing, however, that he\\ndoes not voluntarily take all this burden\\nand disgust upon himself,\\nthat he persistently avoids it, and remains,\\nas i said, quietly and\\nproudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then\\ncertain: he was not\\nmade, he was not predestined for knowledge.  for as\\nsuch, he would one\\nday have to say to himself: \"the devil take my good\\ntaste!  but \\'the\\nrule\\' is more interesting than the exception--than\\nmyself, the\\nexception!\"  and he would go down, and above all, he would\\ngo\\n\"inside.\"  the long and serious study of the average man--and\\nconsequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad\\nintercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one\\'s\\nequals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of\\nevery\\nphilosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and\\ndisappointing\\npart.  if he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child\\nof knowledge\\nshould be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who\\nwill shorten and\\nlighten his task; i mean so-called cynics, those who\\nsimply recognize\\nthe animal, the commonplace and \"the rule\" in\\nthemselves, and at the\\nsame time have so much spirituality and\\nticklishness as to make them\\ntalk of themselves and their like before\\nwitnesses--sometimes they\\nwallow, even in books, as on their own dung-\\nhill.  cynicism is the only\\nform in which base souls approach what is\\ncalled honesty; and the\\nhigher man must open his ears to all the\\ncoarser or finer cynicism, and\\ncongratulate himself when the clown\\nbecomes shameless right before\\nhim, or the scientific satyr speaks\\nout.  there are even cases where\\nenchantment mixes with the disgust--\\nnamely, where by a freak of nature,\\ngenius is bound to some such\\nindiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the\\ncase of the abbe galiani, the\\nprofoundest, acutest, and perhaps also\\nfilthiest man of his century--\\nhe was far profounder than voltaire, and\\nconsequently also, a good\\ndeal more silent.  it happens more frequently,\\nas has been hinted,\\nthat a scientific head is placed on an ape\\'s body, a\\nfine exceptional\\nunderstanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means\\nrare,\\nespecially among doctors and moral physiologists.  and whenever\\nanyone\\nspeaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man\\nas a\\nbelly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one\\nsees, seeks, and wants to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity\\nas the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one\\nspeaks \"badly\"--and not even \"ill\"--of man, then ought the lover of\\nknowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general,\\nto have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation.  for\\nthe\\nindignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself\\nwith\\nhis own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, god, or\\nsociety),\\nmay indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing\\nand\\nself-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more\\nordinary,\\nmore indifferent, and less instructive case.  and no one is\\nsuch a liar\\nas the indignant man.\\n\\n27. it is difficult to be\\nunderstood, especially when one thinks and\\nlives gangasrotogati\\n[footnote: like the river ganges: presto.] among\\nthose only who think\\nand live otherwise--namely, kurmagati [footnote:\\nlike the tortoise:\\nlento.], or at best \"froglike,\" mandeikagati\\n[footnote: like the frog:\\nstaccato.] (i do everything to be \"difficultly\\nunderstood\"\\nmyself!)--and one should be heartily grateful for the\\ngood will to\\nsome refinement of interpretation.  as regards \"the good\\nfriends,\"\\nhowever, who are always too easy-going, and think that as\\nfriends they\\nhave a right to ease, one does well at the very first to\\ngrant them a\\nplay-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one can\\nthus laugh\\nstill; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends--and\\nlaugh\\nthen also!\\n\\n28. what is most difficult to render from one language\\ninto another\\nis the tempo of its style, which has its basis in the\\ncharacter of the\\nrace, or to speak more physiologically, in the\\naverage tempo of the\\nassimilation of its nutriment.  there are\\nhonestly meant translations,\\nwhich, as involuntary vulgarizations, are\\nalmost falsifications of the\\noriginal, merely because its lively and\\nmerry tempo (which overleaps and\\nobviates all dangers in word and\\nexpression) could not also be\\nrendered.  a german is almost\\nincapacitated for presto in his language;\\nconsequently also, as may be\\nreasonably inferred, for many of the most\\ndelightful and daring\\nnuances of free, free-spirited thought.  and just\\nas the buffoon and\\nsatyr are foreign to him in body and conscience,\\nso aristophanes and\\npetronius are untranslatable for him.  everything\\nponderous, viscous,\\nand pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying\\nspecies of style,\\nare developed in profuse variety among germans--pardon\\nme for stating\\nthe fact that even goethe\\'s prose, in its mixture of\\nstiffness and\\nelegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the \"good\\nold time\" to\\nwhich it belongs, and as an expression of german taste at a\\ntime when\\nthere was still a \"german taste,\" which was a rococo-taste\\nin moribus\\net artibus.  lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic\\nnature,\\nwhich understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was\\nnot\\nthe translator of bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in\\nthe shadow of diderot and voltaire, and still more willingly among the\\nroman comedy-writers--lessing loved also free-spiritism in the tempo,\\nand flight out of germany.  but how could the german language, even\\nin\\nthe prose of lessing, imitate the tempo of machiavelli, who in his\\n\"principe\" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of florence, and cannot\\nhelp presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo,\\nperhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he\\nventures to present--long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and\\na\\ntempo of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour?  finally, who\\nwould venture on a german translation of petronius, who, more than any\\ngreat musician hitherto, was a master of presto in invention, ideas,\\nand\\nwords?  what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil\\nworld,\\nor of the \"ancient world,\" when like him, one has the feet of a\\nwind,\\nthe rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which\\nmakes\\neverything healthy, by making everything run!  and with regard\\nto\\naristophanes--that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose\\nsake one pardons all hellenism for having existed, provided one has\\nunderstood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon and\\ntransfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more\\non\\nplato\\'s secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved\\npetit\\nfait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no\\n\"bible,\" nor anything egyptian, pythagorean, or platonic--but a book\\nof\\naristophanes.  how could even plato have endured life--a greek life\\nwhich\\nhe repudiated--without an aristophanes!\\n\\n29. it is the business\\nof the very few to be independent; it is a\\nprivilege of the strong.\\nand whoever attempts it, even with the best\\nright, but without being\\nobliged to do so, proves that he is probably\\nnot only strong, but also\\ndaring beyond measure.  he enters into a\\nlabyrinth, he multiplies a\\nthousandfold the dangers which life in itself\\nalready brings with it;\\nnot the least of which is that no one can see\\nhow and where he loses\\nhis way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal\\nby some minotaur of\\nconscience.  supposing such a one comes to grief, it\\nis so far from\\nthe comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor\\nsympathize\\nwith it.  and he cannot any longer go back!  he cannot even go\\nback\\nagain to the sympathy of men!\\n\\n30. our deepest insights must--and\\nshould--appear as follies, and under\\ncertain circumstances as crimes,\\nwhen they come unauthorizedly to\\nthe ears of those who are not\\ndisposed and predestined for them.  the\\nexoteric and the esoteric, as\\nthey were formerly distinguished by\\nphilosophers--among the indians,\\nas among the greeks, persians, and\\nmussulmans, in short, wherever\\npeople believed in gradations of rank and\\nnot in equality and equal\\nrights--are not so much in contradistinction\\nto one another in respect\\nto the exoteric class, standing without, and\\nviewing, estimating,\\nmeasuring, and judging from the outside, and not\\nfrom the inside; the\\nmore essential distinction is that the class in\\nquestion views things\\nfrom below upwards--while the esoteric class views\\nthings from above\\ndownwards.  there are heights of the soul from which\\ntragedy itself no\\nlonger appears to operate tragically; and if all the\\nwoe in the world\\nwere taken together, who would dare to decide whether\\nthe sight of it\\nwould necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy, and\\nthus to a\\ndoubling of the woe?... that which serves the higher class of\\nmen for\\nnourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely\\ndifferent and lower order of human beings.  the virtues of the common\\nman would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be\\npossible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and\\ngo\\nto ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which\\nhe\\nwould have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which\\nhe\\nhad sunk.  there are books which have an inverse value for the soul\\nand\\nthe health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality,\\nor the\\nhigher and more powerful, make use of them.  in the former case\\nthey are\\ndangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case\\nthey are\\nherald-calls which summon the bravest to their bravery.\\nbooks for the\\ngeneral reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour\\nof paltry people\\nclings to them.  where the populace eat and drink,\\nand even where they\\nreverence, it is accustomed to stink.  one should\\nnot go into churches if\\none wishes to breathe pure air.\\n\\n31. in our\\nyouthful years we still venerate and despise without the art\\nof\\nnuance, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do\\nhard\\npenance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay.\\neverything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, the taste for\\nthe unconditional, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns\\nto introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try\\nconclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life.  the\\nangry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no\\npeace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able\\nto\\nvent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something\\nfalsifying and deceptive.  later on, when the young soul, tortured by\\ncontinual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself--\\nstill\\nardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of\\nconscience: how\\nit upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself,\\nhow it revenges\\nitself for its long self-blinding, as though it had\\nbeen a voluntary\\nblindness!  in this transition one punishes oneself\\nby distrust of one\\'s\\nsentiments; one tortures one\\'s enthusiasm with\\ndoubt, one feels even the\\ngood conscience to be a danger, as if it\\nwere the self-concealment and\\nlassitude of a more refined uprightness;\\nand above all, one espouses\\nupon principle the cause against \"youth.\"\\n--a decade later, and one\\ncomprehends that all this was also still--\\nyouth!\\n\\n32. throughout the longest period of human history--one calls\\nit the\\nprehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was\\ninferred\\nfrom its consequences; the action in itself was not taken\\ninto\\nconsideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in\\nchina at\\npresent, where the distinction or disgrace of a child\\nredounds to\\nits parents, the retro-operating power of success or\\nfailure was what\\ninduced men to think well or ill of an action.  let\\nus call this period\\nthe pre-moral period of mankind; the imperative,\\n\"know thyself!\"  was\\nthen still unknown.--in the last ten thousand\\nyears, on the other hand,\\non certain large portions of the earth, one\\nhas gradually got so far,\\nthat one no longer lets the consequences of\\nan action, but its origin,\\ndecide with regard to its worth: a great\\nachievement as a whole, an\\nimportant refinement of vision and of\\ncriterion, the unconscious effect\\nof the supremacy of aristocratic\\nvalues and of the belief in \"origin,\"\\nthe mark of a period which may\\nbe designated in the narrower sense as\\nthe moral one: the first\\nattempt at self-knowledge is thereby\\nmade.  instead of the\\nconsequences, the origin--what an inversion\\nof perspective!  and\\nassuredly an inversion effected only after long\\nstruggle and wavering!\\nto be sure, an ominous new superstition, a\\npeculiar narrowness of\\ninterpretation, attained supremacy precisely\\nthereby: the origin of an\\naction was interpreted in the most definite\\nsense possible, as origin\\nout of an intention; people were agreed in the\\nbelief that the value\\nof an action lay in the value of its intention.\\nthe intention as the\\nsole origin and antecedent history of an action:\\nunder the influence\\nof this prejudice moral praise and blame have been\\nbestowed, and men\\nhave judged and even philosophized almost up to the\\npresent day.--is\\nit not possible, however, that the necessity may now\\nhave arisen of\\nagain making up our minds with regard to the reversing\\nand fundamental\\nshifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness\\nand acuteness in\\nman--is it not possible that we may be standing on\\nthe threshold of a\\nperiod which to begin with, would be distinguished\\nnegatively as\\nultra-moral: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists,\\nthe\\nsuspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely\\nin that which is not intentional, and that all its intentionalness,\\nall\\nthat is seen, sensible, or \"sensed\" in it, belongs to its surface\\nor\\nskin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but conceals still\\nmore?  in short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or\\nsymptom,\\nwhich first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which\\nhas too\\nmany interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in\\nitself\\nalone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been\\nunderstood\\nhitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice,\\nperhaps a\\nprematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the\\nsame rank\\nas astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which\\nmust be\\nsurmounted.  the surmounting of morality, in a certain sense\\neven the\\nself-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-\\nsecret\\nlabour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most\\nupright,\\nand also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living\\ntouchstones\\nof the soul.\\n\\n33. it cannot be helped: the sentiment of\\nsurrender, of sacrifice for\\none\\'s neighbour, and all self-\\nrenunciation-morality, must be mercilessly\\ncalled to account, and\\nbrought to judgment; just as the aesthetics\\nof \"disinterested\\ncontemplation,\" under which the emasculation of art\\nnowadays seeks\\ninsidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.\\nthere is far\\ntoo much witchery and sugar in the sentiments \"for others\"\\nand \"not\\nfor myself,\" for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,\\nand\\nfor one asking promptly: \"are they not perhaps--deceptions?\"--that\\nthey please--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and\\nalso\\nthe mere spectator--that is still no argument in their favour,\\nbut just\\ncalls for caution.  let us therefore be cautious!\\n\\n34. at\\nwhatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,\\nseen\\nfrom every position, the erroneousness of the world in which we\\nthink\\nwe live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light\\nupon:\\nwe find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into\\nsurmises concerning a deceptive principle in the \"nature of things.\"\\nhe, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently \"the spirit,\"\\nresponsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit, which\\nevery conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--he\\nwho\\nregards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as\\nfalsely deduced, would have at least good reason in the end to become\\ndistrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing\\nupon\\nus the worst of scurvy tricks?  and what guarantee would it give\\nthat\\nit would not continue to do what it has always been doing?  in\\nall\\nseriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and\\nrespect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon\\nconsciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers:\\nfor example, whether it be \"real\" or not, and why it keeps the outer\\nworld so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same\\ndescription.  the belief in \"immediate certainties\" is a moral naivete\\nwhich does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being\\n\"merely moral\" men!  apart from morality, such belief is a folly which\\ndoes little honour to us!  if in middle-class life an ever-ready\\ndistrust\\nis regarded as the sign of a \"bad character,\" and\\nconsequently as an\\nimprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class\\nworld and its yeas\\nand nays, what should prevent our being imprudent\\nand saying: the\\nphilosopher has at length a right to \"bad character,\"\\nas the being who\\nhas hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now\\nunder obligation\\nto distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of\\nevery abyss of\\nsuspicion.--forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace\\nand turn of\\nexpression; for i myself have long ago learned to think\\nand estimate\\ndifferently with regard to deceiving and being deceived,\\nand i keep at\\nleast a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind\\nrage with which\\nphilosophers struggle against being deceived.  why\\nnot?  it is nothing\\nmore than a moral prejudice that truth is worth\\nmore than semblance; it\\nis, in fact, the worst proved supposition in\\nthe world.  so much must be\\nconceded: there could have been no life at\\nall except upon the basis\\nof perspective estimates and semblances; and\\nif, with the virtuous\\nenthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers,\\none wished to do away\\naltogether with the \"seeming world\"--well,\\ngranted that you could do\\nthat,--at least nothing of your \"truth\"\\nwould thereby remain!  indeed,\\nwhat is it that forces us in general to\\nthe supposition that there is an\\nessential opposition of \"true\" and\\n\"false\"? is it not enough to suppose\\ndegrees of seemingness, and as it\\nwere lighter and darker shades and\\ntones of semblance--different\\nvaleurs, as the painters say?  why might\\nnot the world which concerns\\nus--be a fiction?  and to any one who\\nsuggested: \"but to a fiction\\nbelongs an originator?\"--might it not be\\nbluntly replied: why?  may\\nnot this \"belong\" also belong to the fiction?\\nis it not at length\\npermitted to be a little ironical towards the\\nsubject, just as towards\\nthe predicate and object?  might not the\\nphilosopher elevate himself\\nabove faith in grammar?  all respect\\nto governesses, but is it not\\ntime that philosophy should renounce\\ngoverness-faith?\\n\\n35. o voltaire!\\no humanity!  o idiocy!  there is something ticklish in\\n\"the truth,\"\\nand in the search for the truth; and if man goes about it\\ntoo\\nhumanely--\"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien\"--i wager he\\nfinds nothing!\\n\\n36. supposing that nothing else is \"given\" as real but\\nour world of\\ndesires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any\\nother \"reality\"\\nbut just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a\\nrelation of these\\nimpulses to one another:--are we not permitted to\\nmake the attempt and\\nto ask the question whether this which is \"given\"\\ndoes not suffice, by\\nmeans of our counterparts, for the understanding\\neven of the so-called\\nmechanical (or \"material\") world?  i do not mean\\nas an illusion, a\\n\"semblance,\" a \"representation\" (in the berkeleyan\\nand schopenhauerian\\nsense), but as possessing the same degree of\\nreality as our emotions\\nthemselves--as a more primitive form of the\\nworld of emotions, in\\nwhich everything still lies locked in a mighty\\nunity, which afterwards\\nbranches off and develops itself in organic\\nprocesses (naturally also,\\nrefines and debilitates)--as a kind of\\ninstinctive life in which all\\norganic functions, including self-\\nregulation, assimilation, nutrition,\\nsecretion, and change of matter,\\nare still synthetically united with\\none another--as a primary form of\\nlife?--in the end, it is not only\\npermitted to make this attempt, it\\nis commanded by the conscience of\\nlogical method.  not to assume\\nseveral kinds of causality, so long as\\nthe attempt to get along with a\\nsingle one has not been pushed to its\\nfurthest extent (to absurdity,\\nif i may be allowed to say so): that is\\na morality of method which one\\nmay not repudiate nowadays--it follows\\n\"from its definition,\" as\\nmathematicians say.  the question is ultimately\\nwhether we really\\nrecognize the will as operating, whether we believe in\\nthe causality\\nof the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief in\\nthis is just\\nour belief in causality itself--we must make the attempt\\nto posit\\nhypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.\\n\"will\"\\ncan naturally only operate on \"will\"--and not on \"matter\" (not\\non\\n\"nerves,\" for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be\\nhazarded,\\nwhether will does not operate on will wherever \"effects\"\\nare\\nrecognized--and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power\\noperates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will.\\ngranted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire\\ninstinctive\\nlife as the development and ramification of one\\nfundamental form of\\nwill--namely, the will to power, as my thesis puts\\nit; granted that all\\norganic functions could be traced back to this\\nwill to power, and that\\nthe solution of the problem of generation and\\nnutrition--it is one\\nproblem--could also be found therein: one would\\nthus have acquired the\\nright to define all active force unequivocally\\nas will to power.  the\\nworld seen from within, the world defined and\\ndesignated according to\\nits \"intelligible character\"--it would simply\\nbe \"will to power,\" and\\nnothing else.\\n\\n37. \"what?  does not that mean\\nin popular language: god is disproved, but\\nnot the devil?\"--on the\\ncontrary!  on the contrary, my friends!  and who\\nthe devil also\\ncompels you to speak popularly!\\n\\n38. as happened finally in all the\\nenlightenment of modern times with\\nthe french revolution (that\\nterrible farce, quite superfluous when\\njudged close at hand, into\\nwhich, however, the noble and visionary\\nspectators of all europe have\\ninterpreted from a distance their own\\nindignation and enthusiasm so\\nlong and passionately, until the text has\\ndisappeared under the\\ninterpretation), so a noble posterity might once\\nmore misunderstand\\nthe whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make\\nits aspect\\nendurable.--or rather, has not this already happened?  have\\nnot we\\nourselves been--that \"noble posterity\"? and, in so far as we now\\ncomprehend this, is it not--thereby already past?\\n\\n39. nobody will\\nvery readily regard a doctrine as true merely because\\nit makes people\\nhappy or virtuous--excepting, perhaps, the amiable\\n\"idealists,\" who\\nare enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful,\\nand let all\\nkinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities\\nswim about\\npromiscuously in their pond.  happiness and virtue are no\\narguments.\\nit is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of\\nthoughtful\\nminds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as\\nlittle\\ncounter-arguments.  a thing could be true, although it were in\\nthe\\nhighest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental\\nconstitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full\\nknowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured by\\nthe amount of \"truth\" it could endure--or to speak more plainly, by\\nthe\\nextent to which it required truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened,\\ndamped,\\nand falsified.  but there is no doubt that for the discovery\\nof certain\\nportions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more\\nfavourably\\nsituated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to\\nspeak of the\\nwicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are\\nsilent.  perhaps\\nseverity and craft are more favourable conditions for\\nthe development of\\nstrong, independent spirits and philosophers than\\nthe gentle, refined,\\nyielding good-nature, and habit of taking things\\neasily, which are\\nprized, and rightly prized in a learned man.\\npresupposing always,\\nto begin with, that the term \"philosopher\" be not\\nconfined to the\\nphilosopher who writes books, or even introduces his\\nphilosophy into\\nbooks!--stendhal furnishes a last feature of the\\nportrait of the\\nfree-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of\\ngerman taste i will\\nnot omit to underline--for it is opposed to german\\ntaste.  \"pour etre\\nbon philosophe,\" says this last great psychologist,\\n\"il faut etre sec,\\nclair, sans illusion.  un banquier, qui a fait\\nfortune, a une partie du\\ncaractere requis pour faire des decouvertes\\nen philosophie, c\\'est-a-dire\\npour voir clair dans ce qui est.\"\\n\\n40.\\neverything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things\\nhave a hatred even of figure and likeness.  should not the contrary\\nonly\\nbe the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in?  a\\nquestion\\nworth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not\\nalready\\nventured on the same kind of thing.  there are proceedings of\\nsuch a\\ndelicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with\\ncoarseness\\nand make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and\\nof an\\nextravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to\\ntake\\na stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his\\nrecollection.  many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory,\\nin\\norder at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:\\nshame is inventive.  they are not the worst things of which one is\\nmost ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so much\\ngoodness in craft.  i could imagine that a man with something costly\\nand\\nfragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly\\nlike\\nan old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his\\nshame\\nrequiring it to be so.  a man who has depths in his shame meets\\nhis\\ndestiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever\\nreach,\\nand with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most\\nintimate\\nfriends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself\\nfrom their\\neyes, and equally so his regained security.  such a hidden\\nnature,\\nwhich instinctively employs speech for silence and\\nconcealment, and is\\ninexhaustible in evasion of communication, desires\\nand insists that a\\nmask of himself shall occupy his place in the\\nhearts and heads of his\\nfriends; and supposing he does not desire it,\\nhis eyes will some day be\\nopened to the fact that there is\\nnevertheless a mask of him there--and\\nthat it is well to be so.  every\\nprofound spirit needs a mask; nay, more,\\naround every profound spirit\\nthere continually grows a mask, owing to\\nthe constantly false, that is\\nto say, superficial interpretation\\nof every word he utters, every step\\nhe takes, every sign of life he\\nmanifests.\\n\\n41. one must subject\\noneself to one\\'s own tests that one is destined\\nfor independence and\\ncommand, and do so at the right time.  one must not\\navoid one\\'s tests,\\nalthough they constitute perhaps the most dangerous\\ngame one can play,\\nand are in the end tests made only before ourselves\\nand before no\\nother judge.  not to cleave to any person, be it even the\\ndearest--\\nevery person is a prison and also a recess.  not to cleave to\\na\\nfatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is even\\nless difficult to detach one\\'s heart from a victorious fatherland.\\nnot\\nto cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose\\npeculiar\\ntorture and helplessness chance has given us an insight.  not\\nto cleave\\nto a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable\\ndiscoveries,\\napparently specially reserved for us.  not to cleave to\\none\\'s own\\nliberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the\\nbird, which\\nalways flies further aloft in order always to see more\\nunder it--the\\ndanger of the flier.  not to cleave to our own virtues,\\nnor become as\\na whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our\\n\"hospitality\" for\\ninstance, which is the danger of dangers for highly\\ndeveloped\\nand wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently\\nwith\\nthemselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it\\nbecomes\\na vice.  one must know how to conserve oneself--the best test\\nof\\nindependence.\\n\\n42. a new order of philosophers is appearing; i\\nshall venture to baptize\\nthem by a name not without danger.  as far as\\ni understand them, as far\\nas they allow themselves to be understood--\\nfor it is their nature to\\nwish to remain something of a puzzle--these\\nphilosophers of the\\nfuture might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim\\nto be designated as\\n\"tempters.\"  this name itself is after all only an\\nattempt, or, if it be\\npreferred, a temptation.\\n\\n43. will they be new\\nfriends of \"truth,\" these coming philosophers?  very\\nprobably, for all\\nphilosophers hitherto have loved their truths.  but\\nassuredly they\\nwill not be dogmatists.  it must be contrary to their\\npride, and also\\ncontrary to their taste, that their truth should still\\nbe truth for\\nevery one--that which has hitherto been the secret wish\\nand ultimate\\npurpose of all dogmatic efforts.  \"my opinion is my opinion:\\nanother\\nperson has not easily a right to it\"--such a philosopher of the\\nfuture\\nwill say, perhaps.  one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to\\nagree with many people.  \"good\" is no longer good when one\\'s neighbour\\ntakes it into his mouth.  and how could there be a \"common good\"! the\\nexpression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of\\nsmall value.  in the end things must be as they are and have always\\nbeen--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the\\nprofound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up\\nshortly, everything rare for the rare.\\n\\n\\n44. need i say expressly\\nafter all this that they will be free, very\\nfree spirits, these\\nphilosophers of the future--as certainly also they\\nwill not be merely\\nfree spirits, but something more, higher, greater,\\nand fundamentally\\ndifferent, which does not wish to be misunderstood and\\nmistaken?  but\\nwhile i say this, i feel under obligation almost as much\\nto them as to\\nourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and\\nforerunners), to\\nsweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old\\nprejudice and\\nmisunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the\\nconception\\nof \"free spirit\" obscure.  in every country of europe, and the\\nsame in\\namerica, there is at present something which makes an abuse of\\nthis\\nname a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits,\\nwho\\ndesire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts\\nprompt\\n--not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are\\nappearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.\\nbriefly and regrettably, they belong to the levellers, these wrongly\\nnamed \"free spirits\"--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of\\nthe democratic taste and its \"modern ideas\" all of them men without\\nsolitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom\\nneither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they\\nare not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their\\ninnate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and\\nfailure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a\\nnotion\\nwhich happily inverts the truth entirely!  what they would fain\\nattain\\nwith all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow\\nhappiness of the\\nherd, together with security, safety, comfort, and\\nalleviation of life\\nfor every one, their two most frequently chanted\\nsongs and doctrines\\nare called \"equality of rights\" and \"sympathy with\\nall sufferers\"--and\\nsuffering itself is looked upon by them as\\nsomething which must be\\ndone away with.  we opposite ones, however,\\nwho have opened our eye and\\nconscience to the question how and where\\nthe plant \"man\" has hitherto\\ngrown most vigorously, believe that this\\nhas always taken place under\\nthe opposite conditions, that for this\\nend the dangerousness of his\\nsituation had to be increased enormously,\\nhis inventive faculty and\\ndissembling power (his \"spirit\") had to\\ndevelop into subtlety and daring\\nunder long oppression and compulsion,\\nand his will to life had to be\\nincreased to the unconditioned will to\\npower--we believe that severity,\\nviolence, slavery, danger in the\\nstreet and in the heart, secrecy,\\nstoicism, tempter\\'s art and devilry\\nof every kind,--that everything\\nwicked, terrible, tyrannical,\\npredatory, and serpentine in man, serves\\nas well for the elevation of\\nthe human species as its opposite--we do\\nnot even say enough when we\\nonly say this much, and in any case we\\nfind ourselves here, both with\\nour speech and our silence, at the other\\nextreme of all modern\\nideology and gregarious desirability, as their\\nantipodes perhaps?\\nwhat wonder that we \"free spirits\" are not exactly\\nthe most\\ncommunicative spirits?  that we do not wish to betray in every\\nrespect\\nwhat a spirit can free itself from, and where perhaps it will\\nthen be\\ndriven?  and as to the import of the dangerous formula, \"beyond\\ngood\\nand evil,\" with which we at least avoid confusion, we are something\\nelse than \"libres-penseurs,\" \"liben pensatori\" \"free-thinkers,\"\\nand\\nwhatever these honest advocates of \"modern ideas\" like to call\\nthemselves.  having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms\\nof\\nthe spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy,\\nagreeable\\nnooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin,\\nthe accident\\nof men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed\\nto confine us,\\nfull of malice against the seductions of dependency\\nwhich he concealed\\nin honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the\\nsenses, grateful even\\nfor distress and the vicissitudes of illness,\\nbecause they always free\\nus from some rule, and its \"prejudice,\"\\ngrateful to the god, devil,\\nsheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a\\nfault, investigators to the\\npoint of cruelty, with unhesitating\\nfingers for the intangible, with\\nteeth and stomachs for the most\\nindigestible, ready for any business\\nthat requires sagacity and acute\\nsenses, ready for every adventure,\\nowing to an excess of \"free will\",\\nwith anterior and posterior souls,\\ninto the ultimate intentions of\\nwhich it is difficult to pry, with\\nforegrounds and backgrounds to the\\nend of which no foot may run, hidden\\nones under the mantles of light,\\nappropriators, although we resemble\\nheirs and spendthrifts, arrangers\\nand collectors from morning till\\nnight, misers of our wealth and our\\nfull-crammed drawers, economical\\nin learning and forgetting, inventive\\nin scheming, sometimes proud of\\ntables of categories, sometimes\\npedants, sometimes night-owls of\\nwork even in full day, yea, if\\nnecessary, even scarecrows--and it is\\nnecessary nowadays, that is to\\nsay, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn,\\njealous friends of solitude,\\nof our own profoundest midnight and midday\\nsolitude--such kind of men\\nare we, we free spirits!  and perhaps ye are\\nalso something of the\\nsame kind, ye coming ones?  ye new philosophers?\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii.  the\\nreligious mood\\n\\n\\n45. the human soul and its limits, the range of man\\'s\\ninner experiences\\nhitherto attained, the heights, depths, and\\ndistances of these\\nexperiences, the entire history of the soul up to\\nthe present time,\\nand its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the\\npreordained\\nhunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a \"big\\nhunt\". but\\nhow often must he say despairingly to himself: \"a single\\nindividual!\\nalas, only a single individual!  and this great forest,\\nthis virgin\\nforest!\"  so he would like to have some hundreds of\\nhunting assistants,\\nand fine trained hounds, that he could send into\\nthe history of the\\nhuman soul, to drive his game together.  in vain:\\nagain and again he\\nexperiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult\\nit is to find\\nassistants and dogs for all the things that directly\\nexcite his\\ncuriosity.  the evil of sending scholars into new and\\ndangerous\\nhunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in\\nevery sense\\nare required, is that they are no longer serviceable just\\nwhen the \"big\\nhunt,\" and also the great danger commences,--it is\\nprecisely then that\\nthey lose their keen eye and nose.  in order, for\\ninstance, to divine and\\ndetermine what sort of history the problem of\\nknowledge and conscience\\nhas hitherto had in the souls of homines\\nreligiosi, a person would\\nperhaps himself have to possess as profound,\\nas bruised, as immense an\\nexperience as the intellectual conscience of\\npascal; and then he would\\nstill require that wide-spread heaven of\\nclear, wicked spirituality,\\nwhich, from above, would be able to\\noversee, arrange, and effectively\\nformulize this mass of dangerous and\\npainful experiences.--but who\\ncould do me this service!  and who would\\nhave time to wait for such\\nservants!--they evidently appear too\\nrarely, they are so improbable at\\nall times!  eventually one must do\\neverything oneself in order to know\\nsomething; which means that one\\nhas much to do!--but a curiosity like\\nmine is once for all the most\\nagreeable of vices--pardon me!  i mean to\\nsay that the love of truth\\nhas its reward in heaven, and already upon\\nearth.\\n\\n46. faith, such as\\nearly christianity desired, and not infrequently\\nachieved in the midst\\nof a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world,\\nwhich had centuries\\nof struggle between philosophical schools behind\\nit and in it,\\ncounting besides the education in tolerance which\\nthe imperium romanum\\ngave--this faith is not that sincere, austere\\nslave-faith by which\\nperhaps a luther or a cromwell, or some other\\nnorthern barbarian of\\nthe spirit remained attached to his god and\\nchristianity, it is much\\nrather the faith of pascal, which resembles in\\na terrible manner a\\ncontinuous suicide of reason--a tough, long-lived,\\nworm-like reason,\\nwhich is not to be slain at once and with a single\\nblow.  the\\nchristian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice\\nof all\\nfreedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at\\nthe same\\ntime subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation.  there is\\ncruelty\\nand religious phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a\\ntender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for\\ngranted\\nthat the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful,\\nthat all the\\npast and all the habits of such a spirit resist the\\nabsurdissimum, in\\nthe form of which \"faith\" comes to it.  modern men,\\nwith their obtuseness\\nas regards all christian nomenclature, have no\\nlonger the sense for the\\nterribly superlative conception which was\\nimplied to an antique taste by\\nthe paradox of the formula, \"god on the\\ncross\". hitherto there had never\\nand nowhere been such boldness in\\ninversion, nor anything at once so\\ndreadful, questioning, and\\nquestionable as this formula: it promised a\\ntransvaluation of all\\nancient values--it was the orient, the profound\\norient, it was the\\noriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and its\\nnoble, light-\\nminded toleration, on the roman \"catholicism\" of non-faith,\\nand it was\\nalways not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the\\nhalf-stoical\\nand smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith,\\nwhich made\\nthe slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against\\nthem.\\n\"enlightenment\" causes revolt, for the slave desires the\\nunconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in\\nmorals,\\nhe loves as he hates, without nuance, to the very depths, to\\nthe point\\nof pain, to the point of sickness--his many hidden\\nsufferings make\\nhim revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny\\nsuffering.  the\\nskepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally\\nonly an attitude of\\naristocratic morality, was not the least of the\\ncauses, also, of the\\nlast great slave-insurrection which began with\\nthe french revolution.\\n\\n47. wherever the religious neurosis has\\nappeared on the earth so far,\\nwe find it connected with three\\ndangerous prescriptions as to regimen:\\nsolitude, fasting, and sexual\\nabstinence--but without its being possible\\nto determine with certainty\\nwhich is cause and which is effect, or if\\nany relation at all of cause\\nand effect exists there.  this latter doubt\\nis justified by the fact\\nthat one of the most regular symptoms among\\nsavage as well as among\\ncivilized peoples is the most sudden and\\nexcessive sensuality, which\\nthen with equal suddenness transforms into\\npenitential paroxysms,\\nworld-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both\\nsymptoms perhaps\\nexplainable as disguised epilepsy?  but nowhere is it\\nmore obligatory\\nto put aside explanations around no other type has there\\ngrown such a\\nmass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to\\nhave been\\nmore interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps it\\nis time\\nto become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,\\nbetter\\nstill, to look away, to go away--yet in the background of the\\nmost\\nrecent philosophy, that of schopenhauer, we find almost as the\\nproblem\\nin itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious\\ncrisis\\nand awakening.  how is the negation of will possible?  how is the\\nsaint possible?--that seems to have been the very question with which\\nschopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher.  and thus it was a\\ngenuine schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent\\n(perhaps also his last, as far as germany is concerned), namely,\\nrichard\\nwagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here,\\nand should\\nfinally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage\\nas kundry,\\ntype vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that\\nthe\\nmad-doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to\\nstudy\\nthe type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis--or as i\\ncall\\nit, \"the religious mood\"--made its latest epidemical outbreak and\\ndisplay as the \"salvation army\"--if it be a question, however, as to\\nwhat has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all\\nages,\\nand even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint,\\nit\\nis undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely,\\nthe\\nimmediate succession of opposites, of states of the soul regarded\\nas\\nmorally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that\\na \"bad man\" was all at once turned into a \"saint,\" a good man.  the\\nhitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not\\npossible it may have happened principally because psychology had\\nplaced\\nitself under the dominion of morals, because it believed in\\noppositions\\nof moral values, and saw, read, and interpreted these\\noppositions\\ninto the text and facts of the case?  what?  \"miracle\"\\nonly an error of\\ninterpretation?  a lack of philology?\\n\\n48. it seems\\nthat the latin races are far more deeply attached to their\\ncatholicism\\nthan we northerners are to christianity generally, and\\nthat\\nconsequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite\\ndifferent from what it does among protestants--namely, a sort of\\nrevolt\\nagainst the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a\\nreturn to\\nthe spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.\\n\\nwe northerners\\nundoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even\\nas regards\\nour talents for religion--we have poor talents for it.  one\\nmay make\\nan exception in the case of the celts, who have theretofore\\nfurnished\\nalso the best soil for christian infection in the north: the\\nchristian\\nideal blossomed forth in france as much as ever the pale sun\\nof the\\nnorth would allow it.  how strangely pious for our taste are still\\nthese later french skeptics, whenever there is any celtic blood in\\ntheir\\norigin!  how catholic, how un-german does auguste comte\\'s\\nsociology\\nseem to us, with the roman logic of its instincts!  how\\njesuitical, that\\namiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal, sainte-\\nbeuve, in spite of all\\nhis hostility to jesuits!  and even ernest\\nrenan: how inaccessible to\\nus northerners does the language of such a\\nrenan appear, in whom\\nevery instant the merest touch of religious\\nthrill throws his refined\\nvoluptuous and comfortably couching soul off\\nits balance!  let us repeat\\nafter him these fine sentences--and what\\nwickedness and haughtiness is\\nimmediately aroused by way of answer in\\nour probably less beautiful but\\nharder souls, that is to say, in our\\nmore german souls!--\"disons donc\\nhardiment que la religion est un\\nproduit de l\\'homme normal, que l\\'homme\\nest le plus dans le vrai quant\\nil est le plus religieux et le plus\\nassure d\\'une destinee infinie....\\nc\\'est quand il est bon qu\\'il veut que\\nla virtu corresponde a un order\\neternal, c\\'est quand il contemple les\\nchoses d\\'une maniere\\ndesinteressee qu\\'il trouve la mort revoltante et\\nabsurde.  comment ne\\npas supposer que c\\'est dans ces moments-la, que\\nl\\'homme voit le\\nmieux?\"... these sentences are so extremely antipodal\\nto my ears and\\nhabits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage\\non finding them, i\\nwrote on the margin, \"la niaiserie religieuse par\\nexcellence!\"--until\\nin my later rage i even took a fancy to them, these\\nsentences with\\ntheir truth absolutely inverted!  it is so nice and such a\\ndistinction\\nto have one\\'s own antipodes!\\n\\n49. that which is so astonishing in the\\nreligious life of the ancient\\ngreeks is the irrestrainable stream of\\ngratitude which it pours\\nforth--it is a very superior kind of man who\\ntakes such an attitude\\ntowards nature and life.--later on, when the\\npopulace got the upper hand\\nin greece, fear became rampant also in\\nreligion; and christianity was\\npreparing itself.\\n\\n50. the passion for\\ngod: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and\\nimportunate kinds of it,\\nlike that of luther--the whole of protestantism\\nlacks the southern\\ndelicatezza.  there is an oriental exaltation of the\\nmind in it, like\\nthat of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as\\nin the case of\\nst.  augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive\\nmanner, all\\nnobility in bearing and desires.  there is a feminine\\ntenderness and\\nsensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs\\nfor a unio\\nmystica et physica, as in the case of madame de guyon.  in\\nmany cases\\nit appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl\\'s\\nor youth\\'s\\npuberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid,\\nalso as\\nher last ambition.  the church has frequently canonized the woman\\nin\\nsuch a case.\\n\\n51. the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed\\nreverently before\\nthe saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and\\nutter voluntary\\nprivation--why did they thus bow?  they divined in him\\n--and as it were\\nbehind the questionableness of his frail and wretched\\nappearance--the\\nsuperior force which wished to test itself by such a\\nsubjugation; the\\nstrength of will, in which they recognized their own\\nstrength and\\nlove of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured\\nsomething\\nin themselves when they honoured the saint.  in addition to\\nthis, the\\ncontemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion:\\nsuch an\\nenormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have\\nbeen\\ncoveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly.  there is\\nperhaps a\\nreason for it, some very great danger, about which the\\nascetic might\\nwish to be more accurately informed through his secret\\ninterlocutors and\\nvisitors?  in a word, the mighty ones of the world\\nlearned to have a new\\nfear before him, they divined a new power, a\\nstrange, still unconquered\\nenemy:--it was the \"will to power\" which\\nobliged them to halt before the\\nsaint.  they had to question him.\\n\\n52.\\nin the jewish \"old testament,\" the book of divine justice, there are\\nmen, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that greek and\\nindian\\nliterature has nothing to compare with it.  one stands with\\nfear and\\nreverence before those stupendous remains of what man was\\nformerly, and\\none has sad thoughts about old asia and its little out-\\npushed peninsula\\neurope, which would like, by all means, to figure\\nbefore asia as the\\n\"progress of mankind.\"  to be sure, he who is\\nhimself only a slender,\\ntame house-animal, and knows only the wants of\\na house-animal (like\\nour cultured people of today, including the\\nchristians of \"cultured\"\\nchristianity), need neither be amazed nor\\neven sad amid those ruins--the\\ntaste for the old testament is a\\ntouchstone with respect to \"great\" and\\n\"small\": perhaps he will find\\nthat the new testament, the book of grace,\\nstill appeals more to his\\nheart (there is much of the odour of the\\ngenuine, tender, stupid\\nbeadsman and petty soul in it). to have bound\\nup this new testament (a\\nkind of rococo of taste in every respect) along\\nwith the old testament\\ninto one book, as the \"bible,\" as \"the book in\\nitself,\" is perhaps the\\ngreatest audacity and \"sin against the spirit\"\\nwhich literary europe\\nhas upon its conscience.\\n\\n53. why atheism nowadays?  \"the father\" in\\ngod is thoroughly refuted;\\nequally so \"the judge,\" \"the rewarder.\"\\nalso his \"free will\": he does\\nnot hear--and even if he did, he would\\nnot know how to help.  the worst\\nis that he seems incapable of\\ncommunicating himself clearly; is he\\nuncertain?--this is what i have\\nmade out (by questioning and listening\\nat a variety of conversations)\\nto be the cause of the decline of\\neuropean theism; it appears to me\\nthat though the religious instinct is\\nin vigorous growth,--it rejects\\nthe theistic satisfaction with profound\\ndistrust.\\n\\n54. what does all\\nmodern philosophy mainly do?  since descartes--and\\nindeed more in\\ndefiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--an\\nattentat has\\nbeen made on the part of all philosophers on the old\\nconception of the\\nsoul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject\\nand predicate\\nconception--that is to say, an attentat on the\\nfundamental\\npresupposition of christian doctrine.  modern philosophy,\\nas\\nepistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly anti-christian,\\nalthough (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.\\nformerly, in effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in\\ngrammar and the grammatical subject: one said, \"i\" is the condition,\\n\"think\" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity\\nfor\\nwhich one must suppose a subject as cause.  the attempt was then\\nmade,\\nwith marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not\\nget out\\nof this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true:\\n\"think\" the\\ncondition, and \"i\" the conditioned; \"i,\" therefore, only a\\nsynthesis\\nwhich has been made by thinking itself.  kant really wished\\nto prove\\nthat, starting from the subject, the subject could not be\\nproved--nor\\nthe object either: the possibility of an apparent\\nexistence of the\\nsubject, and therefore of \"the soul,\" may not always\\nhave been strange\\nto him,--the thought which once had an immense power\\non earth as the\\nvedanta philosophy.\\n\\n55. there is a great ladder of\\nreligious cruelty, with many rounds; but\\nthree of these are the most\\nimportant.  once on a time men sacrificed\\nhuman beings to their god,\\nand perhaps just those they loved the\\nbest--to this category belong\\nthe firstling sacrifices of all primitive\\nreligions, and also the\\nsacrifice of the emperor tiberius in the\\nmithra-grotto on the island\\nof capri, that most terrible of all roman\\nanachronisms.  then, during\\nthe moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed\\nto their god the strongest\\ninstincts they possessed, their \"nature\";\\nthis festal joy shines in\\nthe cruel glances of ascetics and\\n\"anti-natural\" fanatics.  finally,\\nwhat still remained to be sacrificed?\\nwas it not necessary in the end\\nfor men to sacrifice everything\\ncomforting, holy, healing, all hope,\\nall faith in hidden harmonies, in\\nfuture blessedness and justice?  was\\nit not necessary to sacrifice god\\nhimself, and out of cruelty to\\nthemselves to worship stone, stupidity,\\ngravity, fate, nothingness?\\nto sacrifice god for nothingness--this\\nparadoxical mystery of the\\nultimate cruelty has been reserved for the\\nrising generation; we all\\nknow something thereof already.\\n\\n56. whoever, like myself, prompted by\\nsome enigmatical desire, has long\\nendeavoured to go to the bottom of\\nthe question of pessimism and free it\\nfrom the half-christian, half-\\ngerman narrowness and stupidity in which\\nit has finally presented\\nitself to this century, namely, in the form of\\nschopenhauer\\'s\\nphilosophy; whoever, with an asiatic and super-asiatic\\neye, has\\nactually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of\\nall\\npossible modes of thought--beyond good and evil, and no longer\\nlike\\nbuddha and schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of\\nmorality,\\n--whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without\\nreally\\ndesiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the\\nideal\\nof the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has\\nnot\\nonly learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and\\nis, but\\nwishes to have it again as it was and is, for all eternity,\\ninsatiably\\ncalling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole\\npiece and\\nplay; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires\\nthe play\\n--and makes it necessary; because he always requires\\nhimself anew--and\\nmakes himself necessary.--what?  and this would not\\nbe--circulus\\nvitiosus deus?\\n\\n57. the distance, and as it were the space around man,\\ngrows with the\\nstrength of his intellectual vision and insight: his\\nworld becomes\\nprofounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever\\ncoming into\\nview.  perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye\\nhas exercised\\nits acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion\\nfor its exercise,\\nsomething of a game, something for children and\\nchildish minds.  perhaps\\nthe most solemn conceptions that have caused\\nthe most fighting and\\nsuffering, the conceptions \"god\" and \"sin,\" will\\none day seem to us of\\nno more importance than a child\\'s plaything or a\\nchild\\'s pain seems to\\nan old man;--and perhaps another plaything and\\nanother pain will then\\nbe necessary once more for \"the old man\"--\\nalways childish enough, an\\neternal child!\\n\\n58. has it been observed to\\nwhat extent outward idleness, or\\nsemi-idleness, is necessary to a real\\nreligious life (alike for its\\nfavourite microscopic labour of self-\\nexamination, and for its soft\\nplacidity called \"prayer,\" the state of\\nperpetual readiness for the\\n\"coming of god\"), i mean the idleness with\\na good conscience, the\\nidleness of olden times and of blood, to which\\nthe aristocratic\\nsentiment that work is dishonouring--that it\\nvulgarizes body and\\nsoul--is not quite unfamiliar?  and that\\nconsequently the modern, noisy,\\ntime-engrossing, conceited, foolishly\\nproud laboriousness educates\\nand prepares for \"unbelief\" more than\\nanything else?  among these, for\\ninstance, who are at present living\\napart from religion in germany, i\\nfind \"free-thinkers\" of diversified\\nspecies and origin, but above all\\na majority of those in whom\\nlaboriousness from generation to generation\\nhas dissolved the\\nreligious instincts; so that they no longer know what\\npurpose\\nreligions serve, and only note their existence in the world\\nwith a\\nkind of dull astonishment.  they feel themselves already fully\\noccupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their\\npleasures, not to mention the \"fatherland,\" and the newspapers, and\\ntheir \"family duties\"; it seems that they have no time whatever left\\nfor religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a\\nquestion of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible,\\nthey\\nsay to themselves, that people should go to church merely to\\nspoil\\ntheir tempers.  they are by no means enemies of religious\\ncustoms;\\nshould certain circumstances, state affairs perhaps, require\\ntheir\\nparticipation in such customs, they do what is required, as so\\nmany\\nthings are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and\\nwithout\\nmuch curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and\\noutside\\nto feel even the necessity for a for or against in such\\nmatters.  among\\nthose indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the\\nmajority of\\ngerman protestants of the middle classes, especially in\\nthe great\\nlaborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority\\nof laborious\\nscholars, and the entire university personnel (with the\\nexception of\\nthe theologians, whose existence and possibility there\\nalways gives\\npsychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). on\\nthe part of\\npious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any\\nidea of how\\nmuch good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now\\nnecessary for a\\ngerman scholar to take the problem of religion\\nseriously; his whole\\nprofession (and as i have said, his whole\\nworkmanlike laboriousness, to\\nwhich he is compelled by his modern\\nconscience) inclines him to a\\nlofty and almost charitable serenity as\\nregards religion, with which is\\noccasionally mingled a slight disdain\\nfor the \"uncleanliness\" of spirit\\nwhich he takes for granted wherever\\nany one still professes to belong\\nto the church.  it is only with the\\nhelp of history (not through his own\\npersonal experience, therefore)\\nthat the scholar succeeds in bringing\\nhimself to a respectful\\nseriousness, and to a certain timid deference\\nin presence of\\nreligions; but even when his sentiments have reached the\\nstage of\\ngratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one\\nstep nearer\\nto that which still maintains itself as church or as piety;\\nperhaps\\neven the contrary.  the practical indifference to religious\\nmatters in\\nthe midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually\\nsublimates\\nitself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which\\nshuns\\ncontact with religious men and things; and it may be just the\\ndepth of\\nhis tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the\\ndelicate\\ntrouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--every age has\\nits own\\ndivine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages\\nmay envy\\nit: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly\\nfoolish\\nnaivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in\\nhis superiority,\\nin the good conscience of his tolerance, in the\\nunsuspecting, simple\\ncertainty with which his instinct treats the\\nreligious man as a lower\\nand less valuable type, beyond, before, and\\nabove which he himself has\\ndeveloped--he, the little arrogant dwarf\\nand mob-man, the sedulously\\nalert, head-and-hand drudge of \"ideas,\" of\\n\"modern ideas\"!\\n\\n59.\\nwhoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what\\nwisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial.  it is their\\npreservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and\\nfalse.  here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated\\nadoration\\nof \"pure forms\" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is\\nnot to be\\ndoubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial\\nto that\\nextent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive\\nbeneath it.\\nperhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to\\nthose burnt\\nchildren, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life\\nonly in trying\\nto falsify its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on\\nit), one might\\nguess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the\\nextent to which\\nthey wish to see its image falsified, attenuated,\\nultrified, and\\ndeified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among\\nthe artists, as\\ntheir highest rank.  it is the profound, suspicious\\nfear of an incurable\\npessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten\\ntheir teeth into a\\nreligious interpretation of existence: the fear of\\nthe instinct which\\ndivines that truth might be attained too soon,\\nbefore man has become\\nstrong enough, hard enough, artist enough....\\npiety, the \"life in god,\"\\nregarded in this light, would appear as the\\nmost elaborate and\\nultimate product of the fear of truth, as artist-\\nadoration\\nand artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of\\nall\\nfalsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth\\nat\\nany price.  perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means\\nof\\nbeautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so\\nartful, so\\nsuperficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his\\nappearance no longer\\noffends.\\n\\n60. to love mankind for god\\'s sake--\\nthis has so far been the noblest and\\nremotest sentiment to which\\nmankind has attained.  that love to mankind,\\nwithout any redeeming\\nintention in the background, is only an additional\\nfolly and\\nbrutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to\\nget its\\nproportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling\\nof ambergris\\nfrom a higher inclination--whoever first perceived\\nand \"experienced\"\\nthis, however his tongue may have stammered as it\\nattempted to express\\nsuch a delicate matter, let him for all time be\\nholy and respected, as\\nthe man who has so far flown highest and gone\\nastray in the finest\\nfashion!\\n\\n61. the philosopher, as we free spirits understand him--as\\nthe man of\\nthe greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the\\ngeneral\\ndevelopment of mankind,--will use religion for his\\ndisciplining and\\neducating work, just as he will use the contemporary\\npolitical\\nand economic conditions.  the selecting and disciplining\\ninfluence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can\\nbe\\nexercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to\\nthe\\nsort of people placed under its spell and protection.  for those\\nwho are\\nstrong and independent, destined and trained to command, in\\nwhom the\\njudgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion\\nis\\nan additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of\\nauthority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,\\nbetraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,\\ntheir inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience.  and in the\\ncase of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior\\nspirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative\\nlife, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of\\ngovernment\\n(over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion\\nitself may\\nbe used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and\\ntrouble of\\nmanaging grosser affairs, and for securing immunity from\\nthe unavoidable\\nfilth of all political agitation.  the brahmins, for\\ninstance, understood\\nthis fact.  with the help of a religious\\norganization, they secured to\\nthemselves the power of nominating kings\\nfor the people, while their\\nsentiments prompted them to keep apart and\\noutside, as men with a higher\\nand super-regal mission.  at the same\\ntime religion gives inducement and\\nopportunity to some of the subjects\\nto qualify themselves for future\\nruling and commanding the slowly\\nascending ranks and classes, in which,\\nthrough fortunate marriage\\ncustoms, volitional power and delight in\\nself-control are on the\\nincrease.  to them religion offers sufficient\\nincentives and\\ntemptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to\\nexperience the\\nsentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and\\nof solitude.\\nasceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of\\neducating\\nand ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary\\nbaseness\\nand work itself upwards to future supremacy.  and finally, to\\nordinary\\nmen, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and\\ngeneral\\nutility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives\\ninvaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,\\nennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,\\nwith something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of\\njustification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all\\nthe\\nsemi-animal poverty of their souls.  religion, together with the\\nreligious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually\\nharassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it\\noperates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon\\nsufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,\\nalmost turning suffering to account, and in the end even hallowing and\\nvindicating it.  there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity\\nand buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate\\nthemselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby\\nto retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find\\nit\\ndifficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.\\n62. to be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such\\nreligions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is\\nalways excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as an\\neducational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher,\\nbut\\nrule voluntarily and paramountly, when they wish to be the final\\nend,\\nand not a means along with other means.  among men, as among all\\nother\\nanimals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased,\\ndegenerating,\\ninfirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the\\nsuccessful cases,\\namong men also, are always the exception; and in\\nview of the fact that\\nman is the animal not yet properly adapted to\\nhis environment, the rare\\nexception.  but worse still.  the higher the\\ntype a man represents, the\\ngreater is the improbability that he will\\nsucceed; the accidental, the\\nlaw of irrationality in the general\\nconstitution of mankind, manifests\\nitself most terribly in its\\ndestructive effect on the higher orders of\\nmen, the conditions of\\nwhose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult\\nto determine.  what,\\nthen, is the attitude of the two greatest religions\\nabove-mentioned to\\nthe surplus of failures in life?  they endeavour\\nto preserve and keep\\nalive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the\\nreligions for\\nsufferers, they take the part of these upon principle;\\nthey are always\\nin favour of those who suffer from life as from a\\ndisease, and they\\nwould fain treat every other experience of life as\\nfalse and\\nimpossible.  however highly we may esteem this indulgent and\\npreservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,\\nand applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of\\nman), the hitherto paramount religions--to give a general appreciation\\nof them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of\\n\"man\" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much that which\\nshould\\nhave perished.  one has to thank them for invaluable services;\\nand who is\\nsufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the\\ncontemplation\\nof all that the \"spiritual men\" of christianity have\\ndone for europe\\nhitherto!  but when they had given comfort to the\\nsufferers, courage to\\nthe oppressed and despairing, a staff and\\nsupport to the helpless,\\nand when they had allured from society into\\nconvents and spiritual\\npenitentiaries the broken-hearted and\\ndistracted: what else had they\\nto do in order to work systematically\\nin that fashion, and with a good\\nconscience, for the preservation of\\nall the sick and suffering, which\\nmeans, in deed and in truth, to work\\nfor the deterioration of the\\neuropean race?  to reverse all estimates\\nof value--that is what they\\nhad to do!  and to shatter the strong, to\\nspoil great hopes, to cast\\nsuspicion on the delight in beauty, to\\nbreak down everything autonomous,\\nmanly, conquering, and imperious--\\nall instincts which are natural to the\\nhighest and most successful\\ntype of \"man\"--into uncertainty, distress\\nof conscience, and self-\\ndestruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the\\nearthly and of\\nsupremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and\\nearthly things\\n--that is the task the church imposed on itself, and\\nwas obliged to\\nimpose, until, according to its standard of value,\\n\"unworldliness,\"\\n\"unsensuousness,\" and \"higher man\" fused into one\\nsentiment.  if one\\ncould observe the strangely painful, equally coarse\\nand refined comedy\\nof european christianity with the derisive and\\nimpartial eye of an\\nepicurean god, i should think one would never cease\\nmarvelling and\\nlaughing; does it not actually seem that some single will\\nhas ruled\\nover europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a sublime\\nabortion\\nof man?  he, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer\\nepicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach\\nthis\\nalmost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as\\nexemplified in\\nthe european christian (pascal, for instance), would he\\nnot have to\\ncry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: \"oh, you bunglers,\\npresumptuous\\npitiful bunglers, what have you done!  was that a work\\nfor your hands?\\nhow you have hacked and botched my finest stone!  what\\nhave you presumed\\nto do!\"--i should say that christianity has hitherto\\nbeen the most\\nportentous of presumptions.  men, not great enough, nor\\nhard enough,\\nto be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning man;\\nmen,\\nnot sufficiently strong and far-sighted to allow, with sublime\\nself-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and\\nperishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the\\nradically\\ndifferent grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate\\nman from\\nman:--such men, with their \"equality before god,\" have\\nhitherto swayed\\nthe destiny of europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost\\nludicrous species\\nhas been produced, a gregarious animal, something\\nobliging, sickly,\\nmediocre, the european of the present day.\\nchapter

in europe at present is perhaps as subtle,\\nbelated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the \"science of morals\"\\nbelonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-\\nfingered:--an\\ninteresting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate\\nand obvious\\nin the very person of a moralist.  indeed, the expression,\\n\"science\\nof morals\" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far\\ntoo\\npresumptuous and counter to good taste,--which is always a\\nforetaste of\\nmore modest expressions.  one ought to avow with the\\nutmost fairness what\\nis still necessary here for a long time, what is\\nalone proper for the\\npresent: namely, the collection of material, the\\ncomprehensive survey\\nand classification of an immense domain of\\ndelicate sentiments of worth,\\nand distinctions of worth, which live,\\ngrow, propagate, and perish--and\\nperhaps attempts to give a clear idea\\nof the recurring and more common\\nforms of these living\\ncrystallizations--as preparation for a theory of\\ntypes of morality.\\nto be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.\\nall the\\nphilosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,\\ndemanded of\\nthemselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and\\nceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a\\nscience:\\nthey wanted to give a basic to morality--and every\\nphilosopher hitherto\\nhas believed that he has given it a basis;\\nmorality itself, however, has\\nbeen regarded as something \"given.\"  how\\nfar from their awkward pride\\nwas the seemingly insignificant problem--\\nleft in dust and decay--of a\\ndescription of forms of morality,\\nnotwithstanding that the finest hands\\nand senses could hardly be fine\\nenough for it!  it was precisely owing to\\nmoral philosophers\\' knowing\\nthe moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary\\nepitome, or an accidental\\nabridgement--perhaps as the morality of\\ntheir environment, their\\nposition, their church, their zeitgeist, their\\nclimate and zone--it\\nwas precisely because they were badly instructed\\nwith regard to\\nnations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager\\nto know about\\nthese matters, that they did not even come in sight of the\\nreal\\nproblems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by\\na\\ncomparison of many kinds of morality.  in every \"science of morals\"\\nhitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself\\nhas\\nbeen omitted: there has been no suspicion that there was anything\\nproblematic there!  that which philosophers called \"giving a basis to\\nmorality,\" and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right\\nlight,\\nproved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing\\nmorality, a new\\nmeans of its expression, consequently just a matter-\\nof-fact within the\\nsphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate\\nmotive, a sort of\\ndenial that it is lawful for this morality to be\\ncalled in question--and\\nin any case the reverse of the testing,\\nanalyzing, doubting, and\\nvivisecting of this very faith.  hear, for\\ninstance, with what\\ninnocence--almost worthy of honour--schopenhauer\\nrepresents his own\\ntask, and draw your conclusions concerning the\\nscientificness of a\\n\"science\" whose latest master still talks in the\\nstrain of children and\\nold wives: \"the principle,\" he says (page 136\\nof the grundprobleme der\\nethik), [footnote: pages 54-55 of\\nschopenhauer\\'s basis of morality,\\ntranslated by arthur b.  bullock,\\nm.a.  (1903).] \"the axiom about the\\npurport of which all moralists are\\npractically agreed: neminem laede,\\nimmo omnes quantum potes juva--is\\nreally the proposition which all moral\\nteachers strive to establish,\\n... the real basis of ethics which\\nhas been sought, like the\\nphilosopher\\'s stone, for centuries.\"--the\\ndifficulty of establishing\\nthe proposition referred to may indeed be\\ngreat--it is well known that\\nschopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his\\nefforts; and whoever has\\nthoroughly realized how absurdly false and\\nsentimental this\\nproposition is, in a world whose essence is will\\nto power, may be\\nreminded that schopenhauer, although a pessimist,\\nactually--played the\\nflute... daily after dinner: one may read about\\nthe matter in his\\nbiography.  a question by the way: a pessimist, a\\nrepudiator of god\\nand of the world, who makes a halt at morality--who\\nassents to\\nmorality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?\\nis that\\nreally--a pessimist?\\n\\n187. apart from the value of such assertions as\\n\"there is a categorical\\nimperative in us,\" one can always ask: what\\ndoes such an assertion\\nindicate about him who makes it?  there are\\nsystems of morals which are\\nmeant to justify their author in the eyes\\nof other people; other systems\\nof morals are meant to tranquilize him,\\nand make him self-satisfied;\\nwith other systems he wants to crucify\\nand humble himself, with others\\nhe wishes to take revenge, with others\\nto conceal himself, with others\\nto glorify himself and gave\\nsuperiority and distinction,--this system of\\nmorals helps its author\\nto forget, that system makes him, or something\\nof him, forgotten, many\\na moralist would like to exercise power and\\ncreative arbitrariness\\nover mankind, many another, perhaps, kant\\nespecially, gives us to\\nunderstand by his morals that \"what is estimable\\nin me, is that i know\\nhow to obey--and with you it shall not be\\notherwise than with me!\"  in\\nshort, systems of morals are only a\\nsign-language of the emotions.\\n188. in contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of\\ntyranny against \"nature\" and also against \"reason\", that is, however,\\nno\\nobjection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals,\\nthat\\nall kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is\\nessential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a\\nlong constraint.  in order to understand stoicism, or port royal,\\nor\\npuritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every\\nlanguage has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical\\nconstraint,\\nthe tyranny of rhyme and rhythm.  how much trouble have\\nthe poets and\\norators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting\\nsome of\\nthe prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable\\nconscientiousness--\"for the sake of a folly,\" as utilitarian bunglers\\nsay, and thereby deem themselves wise--\"from submission to arbitrary\\nlaws,\" as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves \"free,\"\\neven\\nfree-spirited.  the singular fact remains, however, that\\neverything\\nof the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and\\nmasterly\\ncertainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in\\nthought itself,\\nor in administration, or in speaking and persuading,\\nin art just as in\\nconduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny\\nof such arbitrary\\nlaw, and in all seriousness, it is not at all\\nimprobable that precisely\\nthis is \"nature\" and \"natural\"--and not\\nlaisser-aller!  every artist\\nknows how different from the state of\\nletting himself go, is his\\n\"most natural\" condition, the free\\narranging, locating, disposing,\\nand constructing in the moments of\\n\"inspiration\"--and how strictly and\\ndelicately he then obeys a\\nthousand laws, which, by their very rigidness\\nand precision, defy all\\nformulation by means of ideas (even the most\\nstable idea has, in\\ncomparison therewith, something floating, manifold,\\nand ambiguous in\\nit). the essential thing \"in heaven and in earth\" is,\\napparently (to\\nrepeat it once more), that there should be long obedience\\nin the same\\ndirection, there thereby results, and has always resulted in\\nthe long\\nrun, something which has made life worth living; for instance,\\nvirtue,\\nart, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever\\nthat is\\ntransfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine.  the long bondage of\\nthe\\nspirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of\\nideas,\\nthe discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think\\nin\\naccordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable\\nto\\naristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret\\neverything that happened according to a christian scheme, and in every\\noccurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god:--all this\\nviolence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,\\nhas proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit\\nhas\\nattained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle\\nmobility;\\ngranted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had\\nto be\\nstifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as\\neverywhere,\\n\"nature\" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant\\nand indifferent\\nmagnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless\\nnoble). that\\nfor centuries european thinkers only thought in order to\\nprove\\nsomething--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every\\nthinker\\nwho \"wishes to prove something\"--that it was always settled\\nbeforehand\\nwhat was to be the result of their strictest thinking, as\\nit was perhaps\\nin the asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is\\nstill at the\\npresent day in the innocent, christian-moral explanation\\nof immediate\\npersonal events \"for the glory of god,\" or \"for the good\\nof the\\nsoul\":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and\\nmagnificent\\nstupidity, has educated the spirit; slavery, both in the\\ncoarser and\\nthe finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even\\nof spiritual\\neducation and discipline.  one may look at every system\\nof morals in this\\nlight: it is \"nature\" therein which teaches to hate\\nthe laisser-aller,\\nthe too great freedom, and implants the need for\\nlimited horizons, for\\nimmediate duties--it teaches the narrowing of\\nperspectives, and thus, in\\na certain sense, that stupidity is a\\ncondition of life and development.\\n\"thou must obey some one, and for a\\nlong time; otherwise thou wilt come\\nto grief, and lose all respect for\\nthyself\"--this seems to me to be the\\nmoral imperative of nature, which\\nis certainly neither \"categorical,\"\\nas old kant wished (consequently\\nthe \"otherwise\"), nor does it address\\nitself to the individual (what\\ndoes nature care for the individual!),\\nbut to nations, races, ages,\\nand ranks; above all, however, to the\\nanimal \"man\" generally, to\\nmankind.\\n\\n189. industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle:\\nit was a\\nmaster stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom\\nsunday to such\\nan extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for\\nhis week--and\\nwork-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly\\nintercalated\\nfast, such as is also frequently found in the ancient\\nworld (although,\\nas is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely\\nwith respect\\nto work). many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever\\npowerful\\ninfluences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that\\nintercalary\\ndays are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered,\\nand learn to\\nhunger anew.  viewed from a higher standpoint, whole\\ngenerations and\\nepochs, when they show themselves infected with any\\nmoral fanaticism,\\nseem like those intercalated periods of restraint\\nand fasting, during\\nwhich an impulse learns to humble and submit\\nitself--at the same time\\nalso to purify and sharpen itself; certain\\nphilosophical sects likewise\\nadmit of a similar interpretation (for\\ninstance, the stoa, in the midst\\nof hellenic culture, with the\\natmosphere rank and overcharged with\\naphrodisiacal odours).--here also\\nis a hint for the explanation of the\\nparadox, why it was precisely in\\nthe most christian period of european\\nhistory, and in general only\\nunder the pressure of christian sentiments,\\nthat the sexual impulse\\nsublimated into love (amour-passion).\\n\\n190. there is something in the\\nmorality of plato which does not really\\nbelong to plato, but which\\nonly appears in his philosophy, one might\\nsay, in spite of him:\\nnamely, socratism, for which he himself was\\ntoo noble.  \"no one\\ndesires to injure himself, hence all evil is done\\nunwittingly.  the\\nevil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do\\nso, however, if\\nhe knew that evil is evil.  the evil man, therefore, is\\nonly evil\\nthrough error; if one free him from error one will necessarily\\nmake\\nhim--good.\"--this mode of reasoning savours of the populace, who\\nperceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and\\npractically\\njudge that \"it is stupid to do wrong\"; while they accept\\n\"good\" as\\nidentical with \"useful and pleasant,\" without further\\nthought.  as\\nregards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once\\nassume that it\\nhas the same origin, and follow the scent: one will\\nseldom err.--plato\\ndid all he could to interpret something refined and\\nnoble into the\\ntenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret\\nhimself into them--he,\\nthe most daring of all interpreters, who lifted\\nthe entire socrates out\\nof the street, as a popular theme and song, to\\nexhibit him in endless\\nand impossible modifications--namely, in all\\nhis own disguises and\\nmultiplicities.  in jest, and in homeric\\nlanguage as well, what is the\\nplatonic socrates, if not--[greek words\\ninserted here.]\\n\\n191. the old theological problem of \"faith\" and\\n\"knowledge,\" or more\\nplainly, of instinct and reason--the question\\nwhether, in respect to the\\nvaluation of things, instinct deserves more\\nauthority than rationality,\\nwhich wants to appreciate and act\\naccording to motives, according to\\na \"why,\" that is to say, in\\nconformity to purpose and utility--it\\nis always the old moral problem\\nthat first appeared in the person of\\nsocrates, and had divided men\\'s\\nminds long before christianity.  socrates\\nhimself, following, of\\ncourse, the taste of his talent--that of a\\nsurpassing dialectician--\\ntook first the side of reason; and, in fact,\\nwhat did he do all his\\nlife but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the\\nnoble athenians, who\\nwere men of instinct, like all noble men, and could\\nnever give\\nsatisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?\\nin the\\nend, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also\\nat\\nhimself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found\\nin\\nhimself the same difficulty and incapacity.  \"but why\"--he said\\nto\\nhimself--\"should one on that account separate oneself from the\\ninstincts!  one must set them right, and the reason also--one must\\nfollow\\nthe instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to\\nsupport them\\nwith good arguments.\"  this was the real falseness of\\nthat great and\\nmysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the\\npoint that he\\nwas satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact,\\nhe perceived\\nthe irrationality in the moral judgment.--plato, more\\ninnocent in such\\nmatters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian,\\nwished to prove to\\nhimself, at the expenditure of all his strength--\\nthe greatest strength\\na philosopher had ever expended--that reason and\\ninstinct lead\\nspontaneously to one goal, to the good, to \"god\"; and\\nsince plato, all\\ntheologians and philosophers have followed the same\\npath--which means\\nthat in matters of morality, instinct (or as\\nchristians call it,\\n\"faith,\" or as i call it, \"the herd\") has hitherto\\ntriumphed.  unless\\none should make an exception in the case of\\ndescartes, the father of\\nrationalism (and consequently the grandfather\\nof the revolution), who\\nrecognized only the authority of reason: but\\nreason is only a tool, and\\ndescartes was superficial.\\n\\n192. whoever\\nhas followed the history of a single science, finds in\\nits development\\na clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest\\nprocesses of\\nall \"knowledge and cognizance\": there, as here, the\\npremature\\nhypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to \"belief,\"\\nand the\\nlack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses\\nlearn\\nlate, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and\\ncautious\\norgans of knowledge.  our eyes find it easier on a given\\noccasion to\\nproduce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon\\nthe\\ndivergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more\\nforce, more \"morality.\"  it is difficult and painful for the ear to\\nlisten to anything new; we hear strange music badly.  when we hear\\nanother language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds\\ninto words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was\\nthus,\\nfor example, that the germans modified the spoken word\\narcubalista into\\narmbrust (cross-bow). our senses are also hostile and\\naverse to the\\nnew; and generally, even in the \"simplest\" processes of\\nsensation, the\\nemotions dominate--such as fear, love, hatred, and the\\npassive emotion\\nof indolence.--as little as a reader nowadays reads\\nall the single words\\n(not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather\\ntakes about five out\\nof every twenty words at random, and \"guesses\"\\nthe probably appropriate\\nsense to them--just as little do we see a\\ntree correctly and completely\\nin respect to its leaves, branches,\\ncolour, and shape; we find it so\\nmuch easier to fancy the chance of a\\ntree.  even in the midst of the\\nmost remarkable experiences, we still\\ndo just the same; we fabricate the\\ngreater part of the experience, and\\ncan hardly be made to contemplate\\nany event, except as \"inventors\"\\nthereof.  all this goes to prove\\nthat from our fundamental nature and\\nfrom remote ages we have\\nbeen--accustomed to lying.  or, to express it\\nmore politely and\\nhypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is\\nmuch more of an artist\\nthan one is aware of.--in an animated\\nconversation, i often see the face\\nof the person with whom i am\\nspeaking so clearly and sharply defined\\nbefore me, according to the\\nthought he expresses, or which i believe to\\nbe evoked in his mind,\\nthat the degree of distinctness far exceeds the\\nstrength of my visual\\nfaculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles\\nand of the expression\\nof the eyes must therefore be imagined by me.\\nprobably the person put\\non quite a different expression, or none at all.\\n\\n193. quidquid luce\\nfuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise.  what we\\nexperience in\\ndreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at\\nlast just as much\\nto the general belongings of our soul as anything\\n\"actually\"\\nexperienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we\\nhave a\\nrequirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and\\neven in\\nthe brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some\\nextent\\nby the nature of our dreams.  supposing that someone has often\\nflown\\nin his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is\\nconscious\\nof the power and art of flying as his privilege and his\\npeculiarly\\nenviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the\\nslightest\\nimpulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who\\nknows\\nthe sensation of a certain divine levity, an \"upwards\"\\nwithout effort\\nor constraint, a \"downwards\" without descending\\nor lowering--without\\ntrouble!--how could the man with such\\ndream-experiences and dream-\\nhabits fail to find \"happiness\" differently\\ncoloured and defined, even\\nin his waking hours!  how could he fail--to\\nlong differently for\\nhappiness?  \"flight,\" such as is described by poets,\\nmust, when\\ncompared with his own \"flying,\" be far too earthly, muscular,\\nviolent,\\nfar too \"troublesome\" for him.\\n\\n194. the difference among men does not\\nmanifest itself only in the\\ndifference of their lists of desirable\\nthings--in their regarding\\ndifferent good things as worth striving\\nfor, and being disagreed as to\\nthe greater or less value, the order of\\nrank, of the commonly recognized\\ndesirable things:--it manifests\\nitself much more in what they regard as\\nactually having and possessing\\na desirable thing.  as regards a woman,\\nfor instance, the control over\\nher body and her sexual gratification\\nserves as an amply sufficient\\nsign of ownership and possession to the\\nmore modest man; another with\\na more suspicious and ambitious thirst for\\npossession, sees the\\n\"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such\\nownership, and\\nwishes to have finer tests in order to know especially\\nwhether the\\nwoman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for\\nhis sake\\nwhat she has or would like to have--only then does he look upon\\nher as\\n\"possessed.\"  a third, however, has not even here got to the limit\\nof\\nhis distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether\\nthe woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do\\nso for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,\\nprofoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let\\nhimself be found out.  only then does he feel the beloved one fully in\\nhis possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when\\nshe loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed\\ninsatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality.  one\\nman would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts\\nof\\ncagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose.  another, with a\\nmore\\nrefined thirst for possession, says to himself: \"one may not\\ndeceive\\nwhere one desires to possess\"--he is irritated and impatient\\nat the idea\\nthat a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the\\npeople: \"i must,\\ntherefore, make myself known, and first of all learn\\nto know myself!\"\\namong helpful and charitable people, one almost\\nalways finds the awkward\\ncraftiness which first gets up suitably him\\nwho has to be helped, as\\nthough, for instance, he should \"merit\" help,\\nseek just their help, and\\nwould show himself deeply grateful,\\nattached, and subservient to them\\nfor all help.  with these conceits,\\nthey take control of the needy as a\\nproperty, just as in general they\\nare charitable and helpful out of a\\ndesire for property.  one finds\\nthem jealous when they are crossed or\\nforestalled in their charity.\\nparents involuntarily make something like\\nthemselves out of their\\nchildren--they call that \"education\"; no mother\\ndoubts at the bottom\\nof her heart that the child she has borne is\\nthereby her property, no\\nfather hesitates about his right to his own\\nideas and notions of\\nworth.  indeed, in former times fathers deemed it\\nright to use their\\ndiscretion concerning the life or death of the newly\\nborn (as among\\nthe ancient germans). and like the father, so also do the\\nteacher, the\\nclass, the priest, and the prince still see in every new\\nindividual an\\nunobjectionable opportunity for a new possession.  the\\nconsequence\\nis...\\n\\n195. the jews--a people \"born for slavery,\" as tacitus and the\\nwhole\\nancient world say of them; \"the chosen people among the\\nnations,\" as\\nthey themselves say and believe--the jews performed the\\nmiracle of the\\ninversion of valuations, by means of which life on\\nearth obtained a new\\nand dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums.\\ntheir prophets fused\\ninto one the expressions \"rich,\" \"godless,\"\\n\"wicked,\" \"violent,\"\\n\"sensual,\" and for the first time coined the word\\n\"world\" as a term of\\nreproach.  in this inversion of valuations (in\\nwhich is also included\\nthe use of the word \"poor\" as synonymous with\\n\"saint\" and \"friend\") the\\nsignificance of the jewish people is to be\\nfound; it is with them that\\nthe slave-insurrection in morals\\ncommences.\\n\\n196. it is to be inferred that there are countless dark\\nbodies near the\\nsun--such as we shall never see.  among ourselves,\\nthis is an allegory;\\nand the psychologist of morals reads the whole\\nstar-writing merely as an\\nallegorical and symbolic language in which\\nmuch may be unexpressed.\\n\\n197. the beast of prey and the man of prey\\n(for instance, caesar borgia)\\nare fundamentally misunderstood,\\n\"nature\" is misunderstood, so long as\\none seeks a \"morbidness\" in the\\nconstitution of these healthiest of\\nall tropical monsters and growths,\\nor even an innate \"hell\" in them--as\\nalmost all moralists have done\\nhitherto.  does it not seem that there is\\na hatred of the virgin\\nforest and of the tropics among moralists?  and\\nthat the \"tropical\\nman\" must be discredited at all costs, whether\\nas disease and\\ndeterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and\\nself-torture?  and\\nwhy?  in favour of the \"temperate zones\"? in favour\\nof the temperate\\nmen?  the \"moral\"? the mediocre?--this for the chapter:\\n\"morals as\\ntimidity.\"\\n\\n198. all the systems of morals which address themselves\\nwith a view to\\ntheir \"happiness,\" as it is called--what else are they\\nbut suggestions\\nfor behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from\\nthemselves in which\\nthe individuals live; recipes for their passions,\\ntheir good and bad\\npropensities, insofar as such have the will to\\npower and would like\\nto play the master; small and great expediencies\\nand elaborations,\\npermeated with the musty odour of old family\\nmedicines and old-wife\\nwisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in\\ntheir form--because\\nthey address themselves to \"all,\" because they\\ngeneralize where\\ngeneralization is not authorized; all of them\\nspeaking unconditionally,\\nand taking themselves unconditionally; all\\nof them flavoured not merely\\nwith one grain of salt, but rather\\nendurable only, and sometimes even\\nseductive, when they are over-\\nspiced and begin to smell dangerously,\\nespecially of \"the other\\nworld.\"  that is all of little value when\\nestimated intellectually,\\nand is far from being \"science,\" much less\\n\"wisdom\"; but, repeated\\nonce more, and three times repeated, it is\\nexpediency, expediency,\\nexpediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity,\\nstupidity--whether it be\\nthe indifference and statuesque coldness\\ntowards the heated folly of\\nthe emotions, which the stoics advised and\\nfostered; or the no-more-\\nlaughing and no-more-weeping of spinoza, the\\ndestruction of the\\nemotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he\\nrecommended so\\nnaively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent\\nmean at which\\nthey may be satisfied, the aristotelianism of morals;\\nor even morality\\nas the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary\\nattenuation and\\nspiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as\\nmusic, or as love\\nof god, and of mankind for god\\'s sake--for in religion\\nthe passions\\nare once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally,\\neven the\\ncomplaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has\\nbeen taught\\nby hafis and goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the\\nspiritual\\nand corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of\\nwise old\\ncodgers and drunkards, with whom it \"no longer has much\\ndanger.\"--this\\nalso for the chapter: \"morals as timidity.\"\\n\\n199. inasmuch as in all\\nages, as long as mankind has existed, there have\\nalso been human herds\\n(family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,\\nstates, churches),\\nand always a great number who obey in proportion\\nto the small number\\nwho command--in view, therefore, of the fact that\\nobedience has been\\nmost practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,\\none may reasonably\\nsuppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is\\nnow innate in\\nevery one, as a kind of formal conscience which gives\\nthe command\\n\"thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally\\nrefrain from\\nsomething\", in short, \"thou shalt\". this need tries to\\nsatisfy itself\\nand to fill its form with a content, according to its\\nstrength,\\nimpatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous\\nappetite\\nwith little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into\\nits ear by\\nall sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class\\nprejudices, or\\npublic opinion.  the extraordinary limitation of human\\ndevelopment,\\nthe hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and\\nturning\\nthereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of\\nobedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command.\\nif\\none imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent,\\ncommanders\\nand independent individuals will finally be lacking\\naltogether, or they\\nwill suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and\\nwill have to impose\\na deception on themselves in the first place in\\norder to be able to\\ncommand just as if they also were only obeying.\\nthis condition of things\\nactually exists in europe at present--i call\\nit the moral hypocrisy of\\nthe commanding class.  they know no other\\nway of protecting themselves\\nfrom their bad conscience than by playing\\nthe role of executors of older\\nand higher orders (of predecessors, of\\nthe constitution, of justice, of\\nthe law, or of god himself), or they\\neven justify themselves by maxims\\nfrom the current opinions of the\\nherd, as \"first servants of their\\npeople,\" or \"instruments of the\\npublic weal\". on the other hand, the\\ngregarious european man nowadays\\nassumes an air as if he were the only\\nkind of man that is allowable,\\nhe glorifies his qualities, such as\\npublic spirit, kindness,\\ndeference, industry, temperance, modesty,\\nindulgence, sympathy, by\\nvirtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and\\nuseful to the herd, as\\nthe peculiarly human virtues.  in cases, however,\\nwhere it is believed\\nthat the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed\\nwith, attempt\\nafter attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders\\nby the summing\\ntogether of clever gregarious men all representative\\nconstitutions,\\nfor example, are of this origin.  in spite of all, what a\\nblessing,\\nwhat a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the\\nappearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans--of\\nthis\\nfact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great\\nproof\\nthe history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history\\nof\\nthe higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in\\nits\\nworthiest individuals and periods.\\n\\n200. the man of an age of\\ndissolution which mixes the races with\\none another, who has the\\ninheritance of a diversified descent in his\\nbody--that is to say,\\ncontrary, and often not only contrary, instincts\\nand standards of\\nvalue, which struggle with one another and are seldom\\nat peace--such a\\nman of late culture and broken lights, will, on an\\naverage, be a weak\\nman.  his fundamental desire is that the war which is\\nin him should\\ncome to an end; happiness appears to him in the character\\nof a\\nsoothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, epicurean\\nor\\nchristian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of\\nundisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the \"sabbath of\\nsabbaths,\" to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, st.\\naugustine,\\nwho was himself such a man.--should, however, the\\ncontrariety and\\nconflict in such natures operate as an additional\\nincentive and stimulus\\nto life--and if, on the other hand, in addition\\nto their powerful and\\nirreconcilable instincts, they have also\\ninherited and indoctrinated\\ninto them a proper mastery and subtlety\\nfor carrying on the conflict\\nwith themselves (that is to say, the\\nfaculty of self-control and\\nself-deception), there then arise those\\nmarvelously incomprehensible and\\ninexplicable beings, those\\nenigmatical men, predestined for conquering\\nand circumventing others,\\nthe finest examples of which are alcibiades\\nand caesar (with whom i\\nshould like to associate the first of europeans\\naccording to my taste,\\nthe hohenstaufen, frederick the second), and\\namong artists, perhaps\\nleonardo da vinci.  they appear precisely in the\\nsame periods when\\nthat weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes\\nto the front; the\\ntwo types are complementary to each other, and spring\\nfrom the same\\ncauses.\\n\\n201. as long as the utility which determines moral estimates\\nis only\\ngregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the\\ncommunity is only\\nkept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely\\nand exclusively in\\nwhat seems dangerous to the maintenance of the\\ncommunity, there can be\\nno \"morality of love to one\\'s neighbour.\"\\ngranted even that there is\\nalready a little constant exercise of\\nconsideration, sympathy, fairness,\\ngentleness, and mutual assistance,\\ngranted that even in this condition\\nof society all those instincts are\\nalready active which are latterly\\ndistinguished by honourable names as\\n\"virtues,\" and eventually almost\\ncoincide with the conception\\n\"morality\": in that period they do not\\nas yet belong to the domain of\\nmoral valuations--they are still\\nultra-moral.  a sympathetic action,\\nfor instance, is neither called good\\nnor bad, moral nor immoral, in\\nthe best period of the romans; and should\\nit be praised, a sort of\\nresentful disdain is compatible with this\\npraise, even at the best,\\ndirectly the sympathetic action is compared\\nwith one which contributes\\nto the welfare of the whole, to the res\\npublica.  after all, \"love to\\nour neighbour\" is always a secondary\\nmatter, partly conventional and\\narbitrarily manifested in relation to\\nour fear of our neighbour.\\nafter the fabric of society seems on the\\nwhole established and secured\\nagainst external dangers, it is this\\nfear of our neighbour which again\\ncreates new perspectives of moral\\nvaluation.  certain strong and\\ndangerous instincts, such as the love of\\nenterprise, foolhardiness,\\nrevengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and\\nlove of power, which up till\\nthen had not only to be honoured from the\\npoint of view of general\\nutility--under other names, of course, than\\nthose here given--but had\\nto be fostered and cultivated (because they\\nwere perpetually required\\nin the common danger against the common\\nenemies), are now felt in\\ntheir dangerousness to be doubly strong--when\\nthe outlets for them are\\nlacking--and are gradually branded as immoral\\nand given over to\\ncalumny.  the contrary instincts and inclinations now\\nattain to moral\\nhonour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its\\nconclusions.  how\\nmuch or how little dangerousness to the community or\\nto equality is\\ncontained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a\\ndisposition, or an\\nendowment--that is now the moral perspective, here\\nagain fear is the\\nmother of morals.  it is by the loftiest and strongest\\ninstincts, when\\nthey break out passionately and carry the individual\\nfar above and\\nbeyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious\\nconscience,\\nthat the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its\\nbelief in\\nitself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these\\nvery\\ninstincts will be most branded and defamed.  the lofty independent\\nspirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are\\nfelt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the\\nherd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called\\nevil, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing\\ndisposition, the mediocrity of desires, attains to moral distinction\\nand\\nhonour.  finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is\\nalways\\nless opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to\\nseverity\\nand rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice,\\nbegins\\nto disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and\\nself-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, \"the lamb,\"\\nand still more \"the sheep,\" wins respect.  there is a point of\\ndiseased\\nmellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which\\nsociety\\nitself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the\\ncriminal,\\nand does so, in fact, seriously and honestly.  to punish,\\nappears to it\\nto be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of\\n\"punishment\" and\\n\"the obligation to punish\" are then painful and\\nalarming to people.  \"is\\nit not sufficient if the criminal be rendered\\nharmless?  why should we\\nstill punish?  punishment itself is\\nterrible!\"--with these questions\\ngregarious morality, the morality of\\nfear, draws its ultimate\\nconclusion.  if one could at all do away with\\ndanger, the cause of fear,\\none would have done away with this morality\\nat the same time, it\\nwould no longer be necessary, it would not\\nconsider itself any longer\\nnecessary!--whoever examines the conscience\\nof the present-day european,\\nwill always elicit the same imperative\\nfrom its thousand moral folds\\nand hidden recesses, the imperative of\\nthe timidity of the herd \"we wish\\nthat some time or other there may be\\nnothing more to fear!\"  some time\\nor other--the will and the way\\nthereto is nowadays called \"progress\" all\\nover europe.\\n\\n202. let us at\\nonce say again what we have already said a hundred\\ntimes, for people\\'s\\nears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--our\\ntruths.  we know\\nwell enough how offensive it sounds when any one\\nplainly, and without\\nmetaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will\\nbe accounted to us\\nalmost a crime, that it is precisely in respect to\\nmen of \"modern\\nideas\" that we have constantly applied the terms \"herd,\"\\n\"herd-\\ninstincts,\" and such like expressions.  what avail is it?  we cannot\\ndo otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is.  we\\nhave found that in all the principal moral judgments, europe has\\nbecome\\nunanimous, including likewise the countries where european\\ninfluence\\nprevails in europe people evidently know what socrates\\nthought he\\ndid not know, and what the famous serpent of old once\\npromised to\\nteach--they \"know\" today what is good and evil.  it must\\nthen sound hard\\nand be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist\\nthat that which\\nhere thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself\\nwith praise\\nand blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the\\nherding human\\nanimal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming\\nmore and more\\nto the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other\\ninstincts,\\naccording to the increasing physiological approximation and\\nresemblance\\nof which it is the symptom.  morality in europe at present\\nis\\nherding-animal morality, and therefore, as we understand the\\nmatter,\\nonly one kind of human morality, beside which, before which,\\nand after\\nwhich many other moralities, and above all higher\\nmoralities, are or\\nshould be possible.  against such a \"possibility,\"\\nagainst such a \"should\\nbe,\" however, this morality defends itself with\\nall its strength, it\\nsays obstinately and inexorably \"i am morality\\nitself and nothing else\\nis morality!\"  indeed, with the help of a\\nreligion which has humoured\\nand flattered the sublimest desires of the\\nherding-animal, things have\\nreached such a point that we always find a\\nmore visible expression of\\nthis morality even in political and social\\narrangements: the democratic\\nmovement is the inheritance of the\\nchristian movement.  that its tempo,\\nhowever, is much too slow and\\nsleepy for the more impatient ones, for\\nthose who are sick and\\ndistracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated\\nby the increasingly\\nfurious howling, and always less disguised\\nteeth-gnashing of the\\nanarchist dogs, who are now roving through the\\nhighways of european\\nculture.  apparently in opposition to the peacefully\\nindustrious\\ndemocrats and revolution-ideologues, and still more so\\nto the awkward\\nphilosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call\\nthemselves\\nsocialists and want a \"free society,\" those are really at one\\nwith\\nthem all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form\\nof\\nsociety other than that of the autonomous herd (to the extent even of\\nrepudiating the notions \"master\" and \"servant\"--ni dieu ni maitre,\\nsays\\na socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to\\nevery\\nspecial claim, every special right and privilege (this means\\nultimately\\nopposition to every right, for when all are equal, no one\\nneeds \"rights\"\\nany longer); at one in their distrust of punitive\\njustice (as though it\\nwere a violation of the weak, unfair to the\\nnecessary consequences of\\nall former society); but equally at one in\\ntheir religion of sympathy,\\nin their compassion for all that feels,\\nlives, and suffers (down to the\\nvery animals, up even to \"god\"--the\\nextravagance of \"sympathy for\\ngod\" belongs to a democratic age);\\naltogether at one in the cry and\\nimpatience of their sympathy, in\\ntheir deadly hatred of suffering\\ngenerally, in their almost feminine\\nincapacity for witnessing it or\\nallowing it; at one in their\\ninvoluntary beglooming and heart-softening,\\nunder the spell of which\\neurope seems to be threatened with a new\\nbuddhism; at one in their\\nbelief in the morality of mutual sympathy, as\\nthough it were morality\\nin itself, the climax, the attained climax of\\nmankind, the sole hope\\nof the future, the consolation of the present,\\nthe great discharge\\nfrom all the obligations of the past; altogether at\\none in their\\nbelief in the community as the deliverer, in the herd, and\\ntherefore\\nin \"themselves.\"\\n\\n203. we, who hold a different belief--we, who regard\\nthe democratic\\nmovement, not only as a degenerating form of political\\norganization, but\\nas equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of\\nman, as involving his\\nmediocrising and depreciation: where have we to\\nfix our hopes?  in\\nnew philosophers--there is no other alternative: in\\nminds strong and\\noriginal enough to initiate opposite estimates of\\nvalue, to transvalue\\nand invert \"eternal valuations\"; in forerunners,\\nin men of the future,\\nwho in the present shall fix the constraints and\\nfasten the knots which\\nwill compel millenniums to take new paths.  to\\nteach man the future\\nof humanity as his will, as depending on human\\nwill, and to make\\npreparation for vast hazardous enterprises and\\ncollective attempts in\\nrearing and educating, in order thereby to put\\nan end to the frightful\\nrule of folly and chance which has hitherto\\ngone by the name of\\n\"history\" (the folly of the \"greatest number\" is\\nonly its last\\nform)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and\\ncommander will\\nsome time or other be needed, at the very idea of which\\neverything that\\nhas existed in the way of occult, terrible, and\\nbenevolent beings might\\nlook pale and dwarfed.  the image of such\\nleaders hovers before our\\neyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud,\\nye free spirits?  the\\nconditions which one would partly have to create\\nand partly utilize for\\ntheir genesis; the presumptive methods and\\ntests by virtue of which\\na soul should grow up to such an elevation\\nand power as to feel a\\nconstraint to these tasks; a transvaluation of\\nvalues, under the new\\npressure and hammer of which a conscience should\\nbe steeled and a heart\\ntransformed into brass, so as to bear the\\nweight of such responsibility;\\nand on the other hand the necessity for\\nsuch leaders, the dreadful\\ndanger that they might be lacking, or\\nmiscarry and degenerate:--these\\nare our real anxieties and glooms, ye\\nknow it well, ye free spirits!\\nthese are the heavy distant thoughts\\nand storms which sweep across the\\nheaven of our life.  there are few\\npains so grievous as to have seen,\\ndivined, or experienced how an\\nexceptional man has missed his way and\\ndeteriorated; but he who has\\nthe rare eye for the universal danger\\nof \"man\" himself deteriorating,\\nhe who like us has recognized the\\nextraordinary fortuitousness which\\nhas hitherto played its game in\\nrespect to the future of mankind--a\\ngame in which neither the hand, nor\\neven a \"finger of god\" has\\nparticipated!--he who divines the fate that\\nis hidden under the\\nidiotic unwariness and blind confidence of\\n\"modern ideas,\" and still\\nmore under the whole of christo-european\\nmorality--suffers from an\\nanguish with which no other is to be compared.\\nhe sees at a glance all\\nthat could still be made out of man through\\na favourable accumulation\\nand augmentation of human powers and\\narrangements; he knows with all\\nthe knowledge of his conviction how\\nunexhausted man still is for the\\ngreatest possibilities, and how often\\nin the past the type man has\\nstood in presence of mysterious decisions\\nand new paths:--he knows\\nstill better from his painfulest recollections\\non what wretched\\nobstacles promising developments of the highest rank\\nhave hitherto\\nusually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become\\ncontemptible.\\nthe universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of\\nthe \"man of the\\nfuture\"--as idealized by the socialistic fools and\\nshallow-pates--this\\ndegeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely\\ngregarious animal (or\\nas they call it, to a man of \"free society\"),\\nthis brutalizing of man\\ninto a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is\\nundoubtedly possible!\\nhe who has thought out this possibility to its\\nultimate conclusion\\nknows another loathing unknown to the rest of\\nmankind--and perhaps\\nalso a new mission!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi.  we scholars\\n\\n\\n204. at the risk\\nthat moralizing may also reveal itself here as that\\nwhich it has\\nalways been--namely, resolutely montrer ses plaies,\\naccording to\\nbalzac--i would venture to protest against an improper and\\ninjurious\\nalteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the\\nbest\\nconscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations\\nof\\nscience and philosophy.  i mean to say that one must have the right\\nout of one\\'s own experience--experience, as it seems to me, always\\nimplies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important\\nquestion\\nof rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or\\nagainst science\\nlike women and artists (\"ah!  this dreadful science!\"\\nsigh their instinct\\nand their shame, \"it always finds things out!\").\\nthe declaration of\\nindependence of the scientific man, his\\nemancipation from philosophy,\\nis one of the subtler after-effects of\\ndemocratic organization and\\ndisorganization: the self-glorification\\nand self-conceitedness of\\nthe learned man is now everywhere in full\\nbloom, and in its best\\nspringtime--which does not mean to imply that\\nin this case self-praise\\nsmells sweet.  here also the instinct of the\\npopulace cries, \"freedom\\nfrom all masters!\"  and after science has,\\nwith the happiest results,\\nresisted theology, whose \"hand-maid\" it had\\nbeen too long, it now\\nproposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to\\nlay down laws for\\nphilosophy, and in its turn to play the \"master\"--\\nwhat am i saying!\\nto play the philosopher on its own account.  my\\nmemory--the memory of\\na scientific man, if you please!--teems with the\\nnaivetes of insolence\\nwhich i have heard about philosophy and\\nphilosophers from young\\nnaturalists and old physicians (not to mention\\nthe most cultured and\\nmost conceited of all learned men, the\\nphilologists and schoolmasters,\\nwho are both the one and the other by\\nprofession). on one occasion it\\nwas the specialist and the jack horner\\nwho instinctively stood on the\\ndefensive against all synthetic tasks\\nand capabilities; at another time\\nit was the industrious worker who\\nhad got a scent of otium and refined\\nluxuriousness in the internal\\neconomy of the philosopher, and felt\\nhimself aggrieved and belittled\\nthereby.  on another occasion it was the\\ncolour-blindness of the\\nutilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but\\na series of refuted\\nsystems, and an extravagant expenditure which \"does\\nnobody any good\".\\nat another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of\\nthe boundary-\\nadjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another\\ntime the\\ndisregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily\\nextended\\nto disregard of philosophy generally.  in fine, i found most\\nfrequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,\\nthe evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the\\nwhole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his\\nscornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the\\nresult being a general ill-will to all philosophy.  (such seems to\\nme,\\nfor instance, the after-effect of schopenhauer on the most modern\\ngermany: by his unintelligent rage against hegel, he has succeeded in\\nsevering the whole of the last generation of germans from its\\nconnection\\nwith german culture, which culture, all things considered,\\nhas been\\nan elevation and a divining refinement of the historical\\nsense, but\\nprecisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor,\\nirreceptive,\\nand un-german to the extent of ingeniousness.) on the\\nwhole, speaking\\ngenerally, it may just have been the humanness, all-\\ntoo-humanness of the\\nmodern philosophers themselves, in short, their\\ncontemptibleness, which\\nhas injured most radically the reverence for\\nphilosophy and opened the\\ndoors to the instinct of the populace.  let\\nit but be acknowledged to\\nwhat an extent our modern world diverges\\nfrom the whole style of the\\nworld of heraclitus, plato, empedocles,\\nand whatever else all the royal\\nand magnificent anchorites of the\\nspirit were called, and with what\\njustice an honest man of science may\\nfeel himself of a better family and\\norigin, in view of such\\nrepresentatives of philosophy, who, owing to\\nthe fashion of the\\npresent day, are just as much aloft as they are down\\nbelow--in\\ngermany, for instance, the two lions of berlin, the anarchist\\neugen\\nduhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann.  it is especially\\nthe\\nsight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves\\n\"realists,\" or \"positivists,\" which is calculated to implant a\\ndangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those\\nphilosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and\\nspecialists,\\nthat is very evident!  all of them are persons who have\\nbeen vanquished\\nand brought back again under the dominion of science,\\nwho at one time\\nor another claimed more from themselves, without\\nhaving a right to the\\n\"more\" and its responsibility--and who now,\\ncreditably, rancorously, and\\nvindictively, represent in word and deed,\\ndisbelief in the master-task\\nand supremacy of philosophy after all,\\nhow could it be otherwise?\\nscience flourishes nowadays and has the\\ngood conscience clearly visible\\non its countenance, while that to\\nwhich the entire modern philosophy has\\ngradually sunk, the remnant of\\nphilosophy of the present day, excites\\ndistrust and displeasure, if\\nnot scorn and pity philosophy reduced to\\na \"theory of knowledge,\" no\\nmore in fact than a diffident science of\\nepochs and doctrine of\\nforbearance a philosophy that never even\\ngets beyond the threshold,\\nand rigorously denies itself the right\\nto enter--that is philosophy in\\nits last throes, an end, an agony,\\nsomething that awakens pity.  how\\ncould such a philosophy--rule!\\n\\n205. the dangers that beset the\\nevolution of the philosopher are, in\\nfact, so manifold nowadays, that\\none might doubt whether this fruit\\ncould still come to maturity.  the\\nextent and towering structure of the\\nsciences have increased\\nenormously, and therewith also the probability\\nthat the philosopher\\nwill grow tired even as a learner, or will attach\\nhimself somewhere\\nand \"specialize\" so that he will no longer attain to\\nhis elevation,\\nthat is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection,\\nand his\\ndespection.  or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his\\nmaturity\\nand strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and\\ndeteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no\\nlonger of much importance.  it is perhaps just the refinement of his\\nintellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the\\nway,\\nhe dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a\\nmilleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost\\nhis self-respect no longer commands, no longer leads, unless he should\\naspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical cagliostro and\\nspiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader.  this is in the last\\ninstance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of\\nconscience.  to double once more the philosopher\\'s difficulties, there\\nis\\nalso the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a yea or nay,\\nnot\\nconcerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he\\nlearns\\nunwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty\\nto obtain\\nthis verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and\\nthe belief\\nonly through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and\\ndestroying)\\nexperiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded.\\nin fact, the\\nphilosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the\\nmultitude, either\\nwith the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with\\nthe religiously\\nelevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and\\ngod-intoxicated\\nman; and even yet when one hears anybody praised,\\nbecause he lives\\n\"wisely,\" or \"as a philosopher,\" it hardly means\\nanything more than\\n\"prudently and apart.\"  wisdom: that seems to the\\npopulace to be a kind\\nof flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing\\nsuccessfully from a\\nbad game; but the genuine philosopher--does it not\\nseem so to us,\\nmy friends?--lives \"unphilosophically\" and \"unwisely,\"\\nabove all,\\nimprudently, and feels the obligation and burden of a\\nhundred attempts\\nand temptations of life--he risks himself constantly,\\nhe plays this bad\\ngame.\\n\\n206. in relation to the genius, that is to\\nsay, a being who either\\nengenders or produces--both words understood\\nin their fullest sense--the\\nman of learning, the scientific average\\nman, has always something of\\nthe old maid about him; for, like her, he\\nis not conversant with the two\\nprincipal functions of man.  to both,\\nof course, to the scholar and\\nto the old maid, one concedes\\nrespectability, as if by way of\\nindemnification--in these cases one\\nemphasizes the respectability--and\\nyet, in the compulsion of this\\nconcession, one has the same admixture\\nof vexation.  let us examine\\nmore closely: what is the scientific man?\\nfirstly, a commonplace type\\nof man, with commonplace virtues: that is\\nto say, a non-ruling, non-\\nauthoritative, and non-self-sufficient type\\nof man; he possesses\\nindustry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,\\nequability and\\nmoderation in capacity and requirement; he has the\\ninstinct for people\\nlike himself, and for that which they require--for\\ninstance: the\\nportion of independence and green meadow without which\\nthere is no\\nrest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration\\n(which first\\nand foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),\\nthe\\nsunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and\\nusefulness, with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of\\nthe heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and\\nagain to be overcome.  the learned man, as is appropriate, has also\\nmaladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and\\nhas a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose\\nelevations\\nhe cannot attain.  he is confiding, yet only as one who\\nlets himself go,\\nbut does not flow; and precisely before the man of\\nthe great current he\\nstands all the colder and more reserved--his eye\\nis then like a smooth\\nand irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved\\nby rapture or sympathy.\\nthe worst and most dangerous thing of which a\\nscholar is capable results\\nfrom the instinct of mediocrity of his\\ntype, from the jesuitism of\\nmediocrity, which labours instinctively\\nfor the destruction of\\nthe exceptional man, and endeavours to break--\\nor still better, to\\nrelax--every bent bow to relax, of course, with\\nconsideration, and\\nnaturally with an indulgent hand--to relax with\\nconfiding sympathy\\nthat is the real art of jesuitism, which has always\\nunderstood how to\\nintroduce itself as the religion of sympathy.\\n\\n207.\\nhowever gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit--and\\nwho has\\nnot been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded\\nipsisimosity!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with\\nregard to one\\'s gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with\\nwhich the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently\\nbeen\\ncelebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were\\nsalvation\\nand glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in\\nthe\\npessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for\\npaying the\\nhighest honours to \"disinterested knowledge\" the objective\\nman, who no\\nlonger curses and scolds like the pessimist, the ideal man\\nof learning\\nin whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after\\na thousand\\ncomplete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most\\ncostly\\ninstruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who\\nis more\\npowerful he is only an instrument, we may say, he is a mirror\\n--he is no\\n\"purpose in himself\" the objective man is in truth a mirror\\naccustomed\\nto prostration before everything that wants to be known,\\nwith such\\ndesires only as knowing or \"reflecting\" implies--he waits\\nuntil\\nsomething comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that\\neven the\\nlight footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not\\nbe lost on\\nhis surface and film whatever \"personality\" he still\\npossesses seems to\\nhim accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener,\\ndisturbing, so much has he\\ncome to regard himself as the passage and\\nreflection of outside forms\\nand events he calls up the recollection of\\n\"himself\" with an effort,\\nand not infrequently wrongly, he readily\\nconfounds himself with other\\npersons, he makes mistakes with regard to\\nhis own needs, and here only\\nis he unrefined and negligent perhaps he\\nis troubled about the health,\\nor the pettiness and confined atmosphere\\nof wife and friend, or the lack\\nof companions and society--indeed, he\\nsets himself to reflect on his\\nsuffering, but in vain!  his thoughts\\nalready rove away to the more\\ngeneral case, and tomorrow he knows as\\nlittle as he knew yesterday how\\nto help himself he does not now take\\nhimself seriously and devote time\\nto himself he is serene, not from\\nlack of trouble, but from lack\\nof capacity for grasping and dealing\\nwith his trouble the habitual\\ncomplaisance with respect to all objects\\nand experiences, the radiant\\nand impartial hospitality with which he\\nreceives everything that\\ncomes his way, his habit of inconsiderate\\ngood-nature, of dangerous\\nindifference as to yea and nay: alas!  there\\nare enough of cases in which\\nhe has to atone for these virtues of his!\\n--and as man generally, he\\nbecomes far too easily the caput mortuum of\\nsuch virtues.  should one\\nwish love or hatred from him--i mean love\\nand hatred as god, woman, and\\nanimal understand them--he will do what\\nhe can, and furnish what he can.\\nbut one must not be surprised if it\\nshould not be much--if he should\\nshow himself just at this point to be\\nfalse, fragile, questionable, and\\ndeteriorated.  his love is\\nconstrained, his hatred is artificial, and\\nrather un tour de force, a\\nslight ostentation and exaggeration.  he is\\nonly genuine so far as he\\ncan be objective; only in his serene totality\\nis he still \"nature\" and\\n\"natural.\"  his mirroring and eternally\\nself-polishing soul no longer\\nknows how to affirm, no longer how to\\ndeny; he does not command;\\nneither does he destroy.  \"je ne meprise\\npresque rien\"--he says, with\\nleibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue\\nthe presque!  neither is\\nhe a model man; he does not go in advance of any\\none, nor after,\\neither; he places himself generally too far off to have\\nany reason for\\nespousing the cause of either good or evil.  if he has\\nbeen so long\\nconfounded with the philosopher, with the caesarian trainer\\nand\\ndictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what\\nis\\nmore essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument,\\nsomething of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave,\\nbut\\nnothing in himself--presque rien!  the objective man is an\\ninstrument,\\na costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring\\ninstrument and\\nmirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and\\nrespected; but he\\nis no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no\\ncomplementary man in whom the\\nrest of existence justifies itself, no\\ntermination--and still less a\\ncommencement, an engendering, or primary\\ncause, nothing hardy, powerful,\\nself-centred, that wants to be master;\\nbut rather only a soft, inflated,\\ndelicate, movable potter\\'s-form,\\nthat must wait for some kind of content\\nand frame to \"shape\" itself\\nthereto--for the most part a man without\\nframe and content, a\\n\"selfless\" man.  consequently, also, nothing for\\nwomen, in parenthesi.\\n208. when a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic\\n--i\\nhope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the\\nobjective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on\\nthat account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many,\\nmany questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so\\nmany, he is henceforth said to be dangerous.  with his repudiation of\\nskepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening\\nsound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried\\nsomewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered\\nrussian\\nnihiline, a pessimism bonae voluntatis, that not only denies,\\nmeans\\ndenial, but--dreadful thought!  practises denial.  against this\\nkind of\\n\"good-will\"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life\\n--there is,\\nas is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific\\nand sedative\\nthan skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of\\nskepticism;\\nand hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the\\nday as an\\nantidote to the \"spirit,\" and its underground noises.  \"are\\nnot our ears\\nalready full of bad sounds?\"  say the skeptics, as lovers\\nof repose, and\\nalmost as a kind of safety police; \"this subterranean\\nnay is terrible!\\nbe still, ye pessimistic moles!\"  the skeptic, in\\neffect, that delicate\\ncreature, is far too easily frightened; his\\nconscience is schooled so\\nas to start at every nay, and even at that\\nsharp, decided yea, and feels\\nsomething like a bite thereby.  yea!\\nand nay!--they seem to him opposed\\nto morality; he loves, on the\\ncontrary, to make a festival to his virtue\\nby a noble aloofness, while\\nperhaps he says with montaigne: \"what do i\\nknow?\"  or with socrates:\\n\"i know that i know nothing.\"  or: \"here i do\\nnot trust myself, no\\ndoor is open to me.\"  or: \"even if the door were\\nopen, why should i\\nenter immediately?\"  or: \"what is the use of any hasty\\nhypotheses?  it\\nmight quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses\\nat all.  are\\nyou absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is\\ncrooked?  to\\nstuff every hole with some kind of oakum?  is there not time\\nenough\\nfor that?  has not the time leisure?  oh, ye demons, can ye not\\nat all\\nwait?  the uncertain also has its charms, the sphinx, too, is a\\ncirce,\\nand circe, too, was a philosopher.\"--thus does a skeptic console\\nhimself; and in truth he needs some consolation.  for skepticism is\\nthe most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological\\ntemperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and\\nsickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long\\nseparated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another.  in the new\\ngeneration, which has inherited as it were different standards and\\nvaluations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt,\\nand\\ntentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very\\nvirtues\\nprevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium,\\nballast,\\nand perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul.\\nthat, however,\\nwhich is most diseased and degenerated in such\\nnondescripts is the\\nwill; they are no longer familiar with\\nindependence of decision, or\\nthe courageous feeling of pleasure in\\nwilling--they are doubtful of the\\n\"freedom of the will\" even in their\\ndreams our present-day europe,\\nthe scene of a senseless, precipitate\\nattempt at a radical blending of\\nclasses, and consequently of races,\\nis therefore skeptical in all its\\nheights and depths, sometimes\\nexhibiting the mobile skepticism which\\nsprings impatiently and\\nwantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with\\ngloomy aspect, like a\\ncloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and\\noften sick unto death\\nof its will!  paralysis of will, where do we not\\nfind this cripple\\nsitting nowadays!  and yet how bedecked oftentimes\\' how\\nseductively\\nornamented!  there are the finest gala dresses and disguises\\nfor this\\ndisease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself\\nnowadays\\nin the show-cases as \"objectiveness,\" \"the scientific spirit,\"\\n\"l\\'art\\npour l\\'art,\" and \"pure voluntary knowledge,\" is only decked-out\\nskepticism and paralysis of will--i am ready to answer for this\\ndiagnosis of the european disease--the disease of the will is diffused\\nunequally over europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization\\nhas longest prevailed, it decreases according as \"the barbarian\"\\nstill\\n--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western\\nculture it is therefore in the france of today, as can be readily\\ndisclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and france,\\nwhich has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the\\nportentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive,\\nnow manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe,\\nby\\nbeing the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the\\npower to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already\\nsomewhat stronger in germany, and again in the north of germany it\\nis\\nstronger than in central germany, it is considerably stronger in\\nengland, spain, and corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and\\nwith hard skulls in the latter--not to mention italy, which is too\\nyoung\\nyet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can\\nexercise\\nwill, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that\\nimmense\\nmiddle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia--\\nnamely, in\\nrussia there the power to will has been long stored up and\\naccumulated,\\nthere the will--uncertain whether to be negative or\\naffirmative--waits\\nthreateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet\\nphrase from our\\nphysicists) perhaps not only indian wars and\\ncomplications in asia would\\nbe necessary to free europe from its\\ngreatest danger, but also internal\\nsubversion, the shattering of the\\nempire into small states, and above\\nall the introduction of\\nparliamentary imbecility, together with the\\nobligation of every one to\\nread his newspaper at breakfast i do not\\nsay this as one who desires\\nit, in my heart i should rather prefer the\\ncontrary--i mean such an\\nincrease in the threatening attitude of\\nrussia, that europe would have\\nto make up its mind to become equally\\nthreatening--namely, to acquire\\none will, by means of a new caste to\\nrule over the continent, a\\npersistent, dreadful will of its own, that\\ncan set its aims thousands\\nof years ahead; so that the long spun-out\\ncomedy of its petty-statism,\\nand its dynastic as well as its democratic\\nmany-willed-ness, might\\nfinally be brought to a close.  the time for\\npetty politics is past;\\nthe next century will bring the struggle for the\\ndominion of the world\\n--the compulsion to great politics.\\n\\n209. as to how far the new\\nwarlike age on which we europeans have\\nevidently entered may perhaps\\nfavour the growth of another and stronger\\nkind of skepticism, i should\\nlike to express myself preliminarily\\nmerely by a parable, which the\\nlovers of german history will already\\nunderstand.  that unscrupulous\\nenthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers\\n(who, as king of prussia,\\nbrought into being a military and skeptical\\ngenius--and therewith, in\\nreality, the new and now triumphantly emerged\\ntype of german), the\\nproblematic, crazy father of frederick the great,\\nhad on one point the\\nvery knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew\\nwhat was then\\nlacking in germany, the want of which was a hundred times\\nmore\\nalarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his\\nill-will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a\\nprofound\\ninstinct.  men were lacking; and he suspected, to his\\nbitterest regret,\\nthat his own son was not man enough.  there,\\nhowever, he deceived\\nhimself; but who would not have deceived himself\\nin his place?  he saw\\nhis son lapsed to atheism, to the esprit, to the\\npleasant frivolity of\\nclever frenchmen--he saw in the background the\\ngreat bloodsucker, the\\nspider skepticism; he suspected the incurable\\nwretchedness of a heart no\\nlonger hard enough either for evil or good,\\nand of a broken will that no\\nlonger commands, is no longer able to\\ncommand.  meanwhile, however,\\nthere grew up in his son that new kind\\nof harder and more dangerous\\nskepticism--who knows to what extent it\\nwas encouraged just by\\nhis father\\'s hatred and the icy melancholy of a\\nwill condemned to\\nsolitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which\\nis closely related\\nto the genius for war and conquest, and made its\\nfirst entrance into\\ngermany in the person of the great frederick.\\nthis skepticism despises\\nand nevertheless grasps; it undermines and\\ntakes possession; it does\\nnot believe, but it does not thereby lose\\nitself; it gives the spirit a\\ndangerous liberty, but it keeps strict\\nguard over the heart.  it is the\\ngerman form of skepticism, which, as\\na continued fredericianism, risen\\nto the highest spirituality, has\\nkept europe for a considerable time\\nunder the dominion of the german\\nspirit and its critical and historical\\ndistrust owing to the\\ninsuperably strong and tough masculine character\\nof the great german\\nphilologists and historical critics (who,\\nrightly estimated, were also\\nall of them artists of destruction\\nand dissolution), a new conception\\nof the german spirit gradually\\nestablished itself--in spite of all\\nromanticism in music and\\nphilosophy--in which the leaning towards\\nmasculine skepticism was\\ndecidedly prominent whether, for instance, as\\nfearlessness of gaze, as\\ncourage and sternness of the dissecting hand,\\nor as resolute will to\\ndangerous voyages of discovery, to\\nspiritualized north pole expeditions\\nunder barren and dangerous skies.\\nthere may be good grounds for it when\\nwarm-blooded and superficial\\nhumanitarians cross themselves before this\\nspirit, cet esprit\\nfataliste, ironique, mephistophelique, as michelet\\ncalls it, not\\nwithout a shudder.  but if one would realize how\\ncharacteristic is\\nthis fear of the \"man\" in the german spirit which\\nawakened europe out\\nof its \"dogmatic slumber,\" let us call to mind the\\nformer conception\\nwhich had to be overcome by this new one--and that\\nit is not so very\\nlong ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with\\nunbridled\\npresumption, to recommend the germans to the interest of\\neurope as\\ngentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.\\nfinally, let us\\nonly understand profoundly enough napoleon\\'s\\nastonishment when he saw\\ngoethe it reveals what had been regarded for\\ncenturies as the \"german\\nspirit\" \"voila un homme!\"--that was as much as\\nto say \"but this is a\\nman!  and i only expected to see a german!\"\\n\\n210. supposing, then,\\nthat in the picture of the philosophers of the\\nfuture, some trait\\nsuggests the question whether they must not perhaps\\nbe skeptics in the\\nlast-mentioned sense, something in them would only be\\ndesignated\\nthereby--and not they themselves.  with equal right they might\\ncall\\nthemselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.\\nby\\nthe name with which i ventured to baptize them, i have already\\nexpressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is\\nthis because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use\\nof experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense?\\nin\\ntheir passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring\\nand\\npainful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a\\ndemocratic\\ncentury can approve of?--there is no doubt these coming\\nones will be\\nleast able to dispense with the serious and not\\nunscrupulous qualities\\nwhich distinguish the critic from the skeptic i\\nmean the certainty as to\\nstandards of worth, the conscious employment\\nof a unity of method,\\nthe wary courage, the standing-alone, and the\\ncapacity for\\nself-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among\\nthemselves a delight\\nin denial and dissection, and a certain\\nconsiderate cruelty, which knows\\nhow to handle the knife surely and\\ndeftly, even when the heart bleeds\\nthey will be sterner (and perhaps\\nnot always towards themselves only)\\nthan humane people may desire,\\nthey will not deal with the \"truth\" in\\norder that it may \"please\"\\nthem, or \"elevate\" and \"inspire\" them--they\\nwill rather have little\\nfaith in \"truth\" bringing with it such revels\\nfor the feelings.  they\\nwill smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one\\nsays in their\\npresence \"that thought elevates me, why should it not be\\ntrue?\"  or\\n\"that work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?\"  or\\n\"that\\nartist enlarges me, why should he not be great?\"  perhaps they\\nwill\\nnot only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus\\nrapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one\\ncould look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein\\nthe intention to reconcile \"christian sentiments\" with \"antique\\ntaste,\"\\nor even with \"modern parliamentarism\" (the kind of\\nreconciliation\\nnecessarily found even among philosophers in our very\\nuncertain and\\nconsequently very conciliatory century). critical\\ndiscipline, and every\\nhabit that conduces to purity and rigour in\\nintellectual matters,\\nwill not only be demanded from themselves by\\nthese philosophers of\\nthe future, they may even make a display thereof\\nas their special\\nadornment--nevertheless they will not want to be\\ncalled critics on that\\naccount.  it will seem to them no small\\nindignity to philosophy to\\nhave it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays,\\nthat \"philosophy itself is\\ncriticism and critical science--and nothing\\nelse whatever!\"  though this\\nestimate of philosophy may enjoy the\\napproval of all the positivists of\\nfrance and germany (and possibly it\\neven flattered the heart and taste\\nof kant: let us call to mind the\\ntitles of his principal works), our new\\nphilosophers will say,\\nnotwithstanding, that critics are instruments of\\nthe philosopher, and\\njust on that account, as instruments, they are\\nfar from being\\nphilosophers themselves!  even the great chinaman of\\nkonigsberg was\\nonly a great critic.\\n\\n211. i insist upon it that people finally cease\\nconfounding\\nphilosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with\\nphilosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give \"each his\\nown,\" and not give those far too much, these far too little.  it may\\nbe necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself\\nshould have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants,\\nthe scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and must remain\\nstanding he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,\\nand\\nhistorian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and\\nriddle-\\nreader, and moralist, and seer, and \"free spirit,\" and almost\\neverything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values\\nand\\nestimations, and that he may be able with a variety of eyes and\\nconsciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up\\nto\\nany height, from a nook into any expanse.  but all these are only\\npreliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands\\nsomething\\nelse--it requires him to create values.  the philosophical\\nworkers, after\\nthe excellent pattern of kant and hegel, have to fix\\nand formalize some\\ngreat existing body of valuations--that is to say,\\nformer determinations\\nof value, creations of value, which have become\\nprevalent, and are for\\na time called \"truths\"--whether in the domain\\nof the logical, the\\npolitical (moral), or the artistic.  it is for\\nthese investigators to\\nmake whatever has happened and been esteemed\\nhitherto, conspicuous,\\nconceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to\\nshorten everything long,\\neven \"time\" itself, and to subjugate the\\nentire past: an immense and\\nwonderful task, in the carrying out of\\nwhich all refined pride, all\\ntenacious will, can surely find\\nsatisfaction.  the real philosophers,\\nhowever, are commanders and law-\\ngivers; they say: \"thus shall it be!\"\\nthey determine first the whither\\nand the why of mankind, and thereby\\nset aside the previous labour of\\nall philosophical workers, and all\\nsubjugators of the past--they grasp\\nat the future with a creative\\nhand, and whatever is and was, becomes\\nfor them thereby a means, an\\ninstrument, and a hammer.  their\\n\"knowing\" is creating, their creating\\nis a law-giving, their will to\\ntruth is--will to power.--are there at\\npresent such philosophers?\\nhave there ever been such philosophers?  must\\nthere not be such\\nphilosophers some day?  ...\\n\\n212. it is always more obvious to me that\\nthe philosopher, as a man\\nindispensable for the morrow and the day\\nafter the morrow, has ever\\nfound himself, and has been obliged to find\\nhimself, in contradiction\\nto the day in which he lives; his enemy has\\nalways been the ideal of his\\nday.  hitherto all those extraordinary\\nfurtherers of humanity whom one\\ncalls philosophers--who rarely\\nregarded themselves as lovers of wisdom,\\nbut rather as disagreeable\\nfools and dangerous interrogators--have found\\ntheir mission, their\\nhard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,\\nhowever, the\\ngreatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of\\ntheir age.\\nin putting the vivisector\\'s knife to the breast of the very\\nvirtues of\\ntheir age, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been\\nfor the\\nsake of a new greatness of man, a new untrodden path to\\nhis\\naggrandizement.  they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy,\\nindolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was\\nconcealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how\\nmuch virtue was outlived, they have always said \"we must remove hence\\nto\\nwhere you are least at home\" in the face of a world of \"modern\\nideas,\"\\nwhich would like to confine every one in a corner, in a\\n\"specialty,\" a\\nphilosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays,\\nwould be compelled\\nto place the greatness of man, the conception of\\n\"greatness,\" precisely\\nin his comprehensiveness and multifariousness,\\nin his all-roundness, he\\nwould even determine worth and rank according\\nto the amount and variety\\nof that which a man could bear and take upon\\nhimself, according to the\\nextent to which a man could stretch his\\nresponsibility nowadays the\\ntaste and virtue of the age weaken and\\nattenuate the will, nothing is\\nso adapted to the spirit of the age as\\nweakness of will consequently, in\\nthe ideal of the philosopher,\\nstrength of will, sternness, and capacity\\nfor prolonged resolution,\\nmust specially be included in the conception\\nof \"greatness\", with as\\ngood a right as the opposite doctrine, with its\\nideal of a silly,\\nrenouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to\\nan opposite age--\\nsuch as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its\\naccumulated\\nenergy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods\\nof\\nselfishness in the time of socrates, among men only of worn-out\\ninstincts, old conservative athenians who let themselves go--\"for the\\nsake of happiness,\" as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their\\nconduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old\\npompous\\nwords to which they had long forfeited the right by the life\\nthey led,\\nirony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the\\nwicked socratic\\nassurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut\\nruthlessly into his\\nown flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the\\n\"noble,\" with a look that\\nsaid plainly enough \"do not dissemble before\\nme!  here--we are equal!\"\\nat present, on the contrary, when throughout\\neurope the herding-animal\\nalone attains to honours, and dispenses\\nhonours, when \"equality of\\nright\" can too readily be transformed into\\nequality in wrong--i mean to\\nsay into general war against everything\\nrare, strange, and privileged,\\nagainst the higher man, the higher\\nsoul, the higher duty, the higher\\nresponsibility, the creative\\nplenipotence and lordliness--at present\\nit belongs to the conception\\nof \"greatness\" to be noble, to wish to be\\napart, to be capable of\\nbeing different, to stand alone, to have to live\\nby personal\\ninitiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his\\nown ideal\\nwhen he asserts \"he shall be the greatest who can be the most\\nsolitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good\\nand evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will;\\nprecisely this shall be called greatness: as diversified as can be\\nentire, as ample as can be full.\"  and to ask once more the question:\\nis\\ngreatness possible--nowadays?\\n\\n213. it is difficult to learn what a\\nphilosopher is, because it cannot\\nbe taught: one must \"know\" it by\\nexperience--or one should have the\\npride not to know it.  the fact\\nthat at present people all talk of things\\nof which they cannot have\\nany experience, is true more especially\\nand unfortunately as concerns\\nthe philosopher and philosophical\\nmatters:--the very few know them,\\nare permitted to know them, and\\nall popular ideas about them are\\nfalse.  thus, for instance, the truly\\nphilosophical combination of a\\nbold, exuberant spirituality which runs\\nat presto pace, and a\\ndialectic rigour and necessity which makes no\\nfalse step, is unknown\\nto most thinkers and scholars from their own\\nexperience, and\\ntherefore, should any one speak of it in their\\npresence, it is\\nincredible to them.  they conceive of every necessity as\\ntroublesome,\\nas a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;\\nthinking\\nitself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating,\\nalmost as\\na trouble, and often enough as \"worthy of the sweat of the\\nnoble\"--but\\nnot at all as something easy and divine, closely related\\nto dancing\\nand exuberance!  \"to think\" and to take a matter \"seriously,\"\\n\"arduously\"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has\\nbeen\\ntheir \"experience.\"--artists have here perhaps a finer intuition;\\nthey\\nwho know only too well that precisely when they no longer do\\nanything\\n\"arbitrarily,\" and everything of necessity, their feeling of\\nfreedom,\\nof subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and\\nshaping,\\nreaches its climax--in short, that necessity and \"freedom of\\nwill\" are\\nthen the same thing with them.  there is, in fine, a\\ngradation of rank\\nin psychical states, to which the gradation of rank\\nin the problems\\ncorresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly\\nevery one who\\nventures too near them, without being predestined for\\ntheir solution\\nby the loftiness and power of his spirituality.  of\\nwhat use is it for\\nnimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest\\nmechanics and empiricists\\nto press, in their plebeian ambition, close\\nto such problems, and as\\nit were into this \"holy of holies\"--as so\\noften happens nowadays!  but\\ncoarse feet must never tread upon such\\ncarpets: this is provided for in\\nthe primary law of things; the doors\\nremain closed to those intruders,\\nthough they may dash and break their\\nheads thereon.  people have always\\nto be born to a high station, or,\\nmore definitely, they have to be bred\\nfor it: a person has only a\\nright to philosophy--taking the word in\\nits higher significance--in\\nvirtue of his descent; the ancestors, the\\n\"blood,\" decide here also.\\nmany generations must have prepared the way\\nfor the coming of the\\nphilosopher; each of his virtues must have been\\nseparately acquired,\\nnurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the\\nbold, easy, delicate\\ncourse and current of his thoughts, but above all\\nthe readiness for\\ngreat responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance\\nand contemning\\nlook, the feeling of separation from the multitude with\\ntheir duties\\nand virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever\\nis\\nmisunderstood and calumniated, be it god or devil, the delight and\\npractice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of\\nwill, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely\\nloves....\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii.  our virtues\\n\\n\\n214. our virtues?--it is\\nprobable that we, too, have still our virtues,\\nalthough naturally they\\nare not those sincere and massive virtues on\\naccount of which we hold\\nour grandfathers in esteem and also at a little\\ndistance from us.  we\\neuropeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings\\nof the twentieth\\ncentury--with all our dangerous curiosity, our\\nmultifariousness and\\nart of disguising, our mellow and seemingly\\nsweetened cruelty in sense\\nand spirit--we shall presumably, if we must\\nhave virtues, have those\\nonly which have come to agreement with our most\\nsecret and heartfelt\\ninclinations, with our most ardent requirements:\\nwell, then, let us\\nlook for them in our labyrinths!--where, as we know,\\nso many things\\nlose themselves, so many things get quite lost!  and is\\nthere anything\\nfiner than to search for one\\'s own virtues?  is it not\\nalmost to\\nbelieve in one\\'s own virtues?  but this \"believing in one\\'s\\nown\\nvirtues\"--is it not practically the same as what was formerly called\\none\\'s \"good conscience,\" that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,\\nwhich our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often\\nenough\\nalso behind their understandings?  it seems, therefore, that\\nhowever\\nlittle we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and\\ngrandfatherly\\nrespectable in other respects, in one thing we are\\nnevertheless the\\nworthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last\\neuropeans with good\\nconsciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--\\nah!  if you only knew how\\nsoon, so very soon--it will be different!\\n215. as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which\\ndetermine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of\\ndifferent\\ncolours shine around a single planet, now with red light,\\nnow with\\ngreen, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with\\nmotley\\ncolours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism\\nof our\\n\"firmament,\" are determined by different moralities; our\\nactions shine\\nalternately in different colours, and are seldom\\nunequivocal--and there\\nare often cases, also, in which our actions are\\nmotley-coloured.\\n\\n216. to love one\\'s enemies?  i think that has been\\nwell learnt: it takes\\nplace thousands of times at present on a large\\nand small scale; indeed,\\nat times the higher and sublimer thing takes\\nplace:--we learn to despise\\nwhen we love, and precisely when we love\\nbest; all of it, however,\\nunconsciously, without noise, without\\nostentation, with the shame and\\nsecrecy of goodness, which forbids the\\nutterance of the pompous word\\nand the formula of virtue.  morality as\\nattitude--is opposed to our taste\\nnowadays.  this is also an advance,\\nas it was an advance in our fathers\\nthat religion as an attitude\\nfinally became opposed to their taste,\\nincluding the enmity and\\nvoltairean bitterness against religion (and all\\nthat formerly belonged\\nto freethinker-pantomime). it is the music in our\\nconscience, the\\ndance in our spirit, to which puritan litanies, moral\\nsermons, and\\ngoody-goodness won\\'t chime.\\n\\n217. let us be careful in dealing with\\nthose who attach great importance\\nto being credited with moral tact\\nand subtlety in moral discernment!\\nthey never forgive us if they have\\nonce made a mistake before us\\n(or even with regard to us)--they\\ninevitably become our instinctive\\ncalumniators and detractors, even\\nwhen they still remain our\\n\"friends.\"--blessed are the forgetful: for\\nthey \"get the better\" even of\\ntheir blunders.\\n\\n218. the psychologists\\nof france--and where else are there still\\npsychologists nowadays?--\\nhave never yet exhausted their bitter and\\nmanifold enjoyment of the\\nbetise bourgeoise, just as though... in\\nshort, they betray something\\nthereby.  flaubert, for instance, the honest\\ncitizen of rouen, neither\\nsaw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the\\nend; it was his mode of\\nself-torment and refined cruelty.  as this is\\ngrowing wearisome, i\\nwould now recommend for a change something else\\nfor a pleasure--\\nnamely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,\\nhonest\\nmediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks\\nthey\\nhave to perform, the subtle, barbed, jesuitical astuteness, which\\nis a\\nthousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the\\nmiddle-\\nclass in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding of\\nits\\nvictims:--a repeated proof that \"instinct\" is the most intelligent\\nof\\nall kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered.  in\\nshort, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the \"rule\" in its\\nstruggle with the \"exception\": there you have a spectacle fit for gods\\nand godlike malignity!  or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on\\n\"good people,\" on the \"homo bonae voluntatis,\" on yourselves!\\n\\n219.\\nthe practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite\\nrevenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is\\nalso a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature,\\nand\\nfinally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming\\nsubtle\\n--malice spiritualises.  they are glad in their inmost heart that\\nthere is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with\\nintellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for\\nthe \"equality of all before god,\" and almost need the belief in god\\nfor\\nthis purpose.  it is among them that the most powerful antagonists\\nof\\natheism are found.  if any one were to say to them \"a lofty\\nspirituality\\nis beyond all comparison with the honesty and\\nrespectability of a merely\\nmoral man\"--it would make them furious, i\\nshall take care not to say\\nso.  i would rather flatter them with my\\ntheory that lofty spirituality\\nitself exists only as the ultimate\\nproduct of moral qualities, that it\\nis a synthesis of all qualities\\nattributed to the \"merely moral\" man,\\nafter they have been acquired\\nsingly through long training and practice,\\nperhaps during a whole\\nseries of generations, that lofty spirituality\\nis precisely the\\nspiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity\\nwhich knows\\nthat it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in the\\nworld,\\neven among things--and not only among men.\\n\\n220. now that the praise\\nof the \"disinterested person\" is so popular\\none must--probably not\\nwithout some danger--get an idea of what people\\nactually take an\\ninterest in, and what are the things generally which\\nfundamentally and\\nprofoundly concern ordinary men--including the\\ncultured, even the\\nlearned, and perhaps philosophers also, if\\nappearances do not deceive.\\nthe fact thereby becomes obvious that the\\ngreater part of what\\ninterests and charms higher natures, and more\\nrefined and fastidious\\ntastes, seems absolutely \"uninteresting\" to\\nthe average man--if,\\nnotwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these\\ninterests, he calls it\\ndesinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to\\nact \"disinterestedly.\"\\nthere have been philosophers who could give this\\npopular astonishment\\na seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression\\n(perhaps because\\nthey did not know the higher nature by experience?),\\ninstead of\\nstating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that\\n\"disinterested\"\\naction is very interesting and \"interested\" action,\\nprovided that...\\n\"and love?\"--what!  even an action for love\\'s sake\\nshall be\\n\"unegoistic\"? but you fools--! \"and the praise of the\\nself-\\nsacrificer?\"--but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that\\nhe\\nwanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himself\\nfor something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have\\nmore there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself\\n\"more.\"\\nbut this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more\\nfastidious\\nspirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle\\nher yawns so\\nmuch when she is obliged to answer.  and after all, truth\\nis a woman; one\\nmust not use force with her.\\n\\n221. \"it sometimes\\nhappens,\" said a moralistic pedant and\\ntrifle-retailer, \"that i honour\\nand respect an unselfish man: not,\\nhowever, because he is unselfish,\\nbut because i think he has a right to\\nbe useful to another man at his\\nown expense.  in short, the question\\nis always who he is, and who the\\nother is.  for instance, in a person\\ncreated and destined for command,\\nself-denial and modest retirement,\\ninstead of being virtues, would be\\nthe waste of virtues: so it seems\\nto me.  every system of unegoistic\\nmorality which takes itself\\nunconditionally and appeals to every one,\\nnot only sins against good\\ntaste, but is also an incentive to sins of\\nomission, an additional\\nseduction under the mask of philanthropy--and\\nprecisely a seduction and\\ninjury to the higher, rarer, and more\\nprivileged types of men.  moral\\nsystems must be compelled first of all\\nto bow before the gradations of\\nrank; their presumption must be driven\\nhome to their conscience--until\\nthey thoroughly understand at last\\nthat it is immoral to say that \\'what\\nis right for one is proper for\\nanother.\\'\"--so said my moralistic pedant\\nand bonhomme.  did he perhaps\\ndeserve to be laughed at when he thus\\nexhorted systems of morals to\\npractise morality?  but one should not be\\ntoo much in the right if one\\nwishes to have the laughers on one\\'s own\\nside; a grain of wrong\\npertains even to good taste.\\n\\n222. wherever sympathy (fellow-\\nsuffering) is preached nowadays--and,\\nif i gather rightly, no other\\nreligion is any longer preached--let the\\npsychologist have his ears\\nopen through all the vanity, through all the\\nnoise which is natural to\\nthese preachers (as to all preachers), he will\\nhear a hoarse,\\ngroaning, genuine note of self-contempt.  it belongs\\nto the\\novershadowing and uglifying of europe, which has been on\\nthe increase\\nfor a century (the first symptoms of which are already\\nspecified\\ndocumentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame\\nd\\'epinay)--if it is not really the cause thereof!  the man of\\n\"modern\\nideas,\" the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with\\nhimself--\\nthis is perfectly certain.  he suffers, and his vanity wants him\\nonly\\n\"to suffer with his fellows.\"\\n\\n223. the hybrid european--a tolerably\\nugly plebeian, taken all in\\nall--absolutely requires a costume: he\\nneeds history as a storeroom\\nof costumes.  to be sure, he notices that\\nnone of the costumes fit him\\nproperly--he changes and changes.  let us\\nlook at the nineteenth century\\nwith respect to these hasty preferences\\nand changes in its masquerades\\nof style, and also with respect to its\\nmoments of desperation on account\\nof \"nothing suiting\" us.  it is in\\nvain to get ourselves up as romantic,\\nor classical, or christian, or\\nflorentine, or barocco, or \"national,\"\\nin moribus et artibus: it does\\nnot \"clothe us\"! but the \"spirit,\"\\nespecially the \"historical spirit,\"\\nprofits even by this desperation:\\nonce and again a new sample of the\\npast or of the foreign is tested,\\nput on, taken off, packed up, and\\nabove all studied--we are the first\\nstudious age in puncto of\\n\"costumes,\" i mean as concerns morals,\\narticles of belief, artistic\\ntastes, and religions; we are prepared as\\nno other age has ever been\\nfor a carnival in the grand style, for the\\nmost spiritual festival--\\nlaughter and arrogance, for the transcendental\\nheight of supreme folly\\nand aristophanic ridicule of the world.  perhaps\\nwe are still\\ndiscovering the domain of our invention just here, the\\ndomain where\\neven we can still be original, probably as parodists of\\nthe world\\'s\\nhistory and as god\\'s merry-andrews,--perhaps, though nothing\\nelse of\\nthe present have a future, our laughter itself may have a\\nfuture!\\n224. the historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly\\nthe\\norder of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a\\ncommunity, or an individual has lived, the \"divining instinct\" for the\\nrelationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority\\nof the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),--this\\nhistorical sense, which we europeans claim as our specialty, has come\\nto us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which\\neurope has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and\\nraces--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this\\nfaculty as its sixth sense.  owing to this mingling, the past of every\\nform and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely\\ncontiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us\\n\"modern\\nsouls\"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we\\nourselves are\\na kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit\\nperceives its\\nadvantage therein.  by means of our semi-barbarity in\\nbody and in desire,\\nwe have secret access everywhere, such as a noble\\nage never had; we have\\naccess above all to the labyrinth of imperfect\\ncivilizations, and to\\nevery form of semi-barbarity that has at any\\ntime existed on earth; and\\nin so far as the most considerable part of\\nhuman civilization hitherto\\nhas just been semi-barbarity, the\\n\"historical sense\" implies almost the\\nsense and instinct for\\neverything, the taste and tongue for everything:\\nwhereby it\\nimmediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense.  for\\ninstance, we\\nenjoy homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest\\nacquisition that we\\nknow how to appreciate homer, whom men of\\ndistinguished culture (as\\nthe french of the seventeenth century, like\\nsaint-evremond, who\\nreproached him for his esprit vaste, and even\\nvoltaire, the last echo\\nof the century) cannot and could not so easily\\nappropriate--whom they\\nscarcely permitted themselves to enjoy.  the very\\ndecided yea and nay\\nof their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their\\nhesitating\\nreluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of\\nthe bad\\ntaste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of\\nevery\\ndistinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire,\\na\\ndissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is\\nstrange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even\\ntowards\\nthe best things of the world which are not their property or\\ncould not\\nbecome their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to\\nsuch men\\nthan just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian\\ncuriosity.  the case is not different with shakespeare, that marvelous\\nspanish-moorish-saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient\\nathenian\\nof the circle of aeschylus would have half-killed himself\\nwith laughter\\nor irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild\\nmotleyness, this\\nmedley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the\\nmost artificial,\\nwith a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it\\nas a refinement\\nof art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves\\nto be as little\\ndisturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of\\nthe english\\npopulace in which shakespeare\\'s art and taste lives, as\\nperhaps on\\nthe chiaja of naples, where, with all our senses awake, we\\ngo our way,\\nenchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of\\nthe lower\\nquarters of the town.  that as men of the \"historical sense\"\\nwe have\\nour virtues, is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious,\\nunselfish,\\nmodest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-\\nrenunciation, very\\ngrateful, very patient, very complaisant--but with\\nall this we are\\nperhaps not very \"tasteful.\"  let us finally confess\\nit, that what is\\nmost difficult for us men of the \"historical sense\"\\nto grasp, feel,\\ntaste, and love, what finds us fundamentally\\nprejudiced and almost\\nhostile, is precisely the perfection and\\nultimate maturity in every\\nculture and art, the essentially noble in\\nworks and men, their moment\\nof smooth sea and halcyon self-\\nsufficiency, the goldenness and coldness\\nwhich all things show that\\nhave perfected themselves.  perhaps our great\\nvirtue of the historical\\nsense is in necessary contrast to good taste,\\nat least to the very bad\\ntaste; and we can only evoke in ourselves\\nimperfectly, hesitatingly,\\nand with compulsion the small, short, and\\nhappy godsends and\\nglorifications of human life as they shine here and\\nthere: those\\nmoments and marvelous experiences when a great power has\\nvoluntarily\\ncome to a halt before the boundless and infinite,--when a\\nsuper-\\nabundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking\\nand\\npetrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still\\ntrembling ground.  proportionateness is strange to us, let us confess\\nit\\nto ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite,\\nthe\\nimmeasurable.  like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let\\nthe\\nreins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians\\n--and\\nare only in our highest bliss when we--are in most danger.\\n\\n225.\\nwhether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,\\nall\\nthose modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according\\nto\\npleasure and pain, that is, according to accompanying circumstances\\nand secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and\\nnaivetes, which every one conscious of creative powers and an artist\\'s\\nconscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without\\nsympathy.\\nsympathy for you!--to be sure, that is not sympathy as you\\nunderstand\\nit: it is not sympathy for social \"distress,\" for \"society\"\\nwith its\\nsick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and\\ndefective who lie\\non the ground around us; still less is it sympathy\\nfor the grumbling,\\nvexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after\\npower--they call it\\n\"freedom.\"  our sympathy is a loftier and further-\\nsighted sympathy:--we\\nsee how man dwarfs himself, how you dwarf him!\\nand there are moments\\nwhen we view your sympathy with an indescribable\\nanguish, when we resist\\nit,--when we regard your seriousness as more\\ndangerous than any kind\\nof levity.  you want, if possible--and there\\nis not a more foolish \"if\\npossible\"--to do away with suffering; and\\nwe?--it really seems that we\\nwould rather have it increased and made\\nworse than it has ever been!\\nwell-being, as you understand it--is\\ncertainly not a goal; it seems\\nto us an end; a condition which at once\\nrenders man ludicrous and\\ncontemptible--and makes his destruction\\ndesirable!  the discipline\\nof suffering, of great suffering--know ye\\nnot that it is only this\\ndiscipline that has produced all the\\nelevations of humanity hitherto?\\nthe tension of soul in misfortune\\nwhich communicates to it its energy,\\nits shuddering in view of rack\\nand ruin, its inventiveness and bravery\\nin undergoing, enduring,\\ninterpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and\\nwhatever depth, mystery,\\ndisguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has\\nbeen bestowed upon the\\nsoul--has it not been bestowed through suffering,\\nthrough the\\ndiscipline of great suffering?  in man creature and creator\\nare\\nunited: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire,\\nfolly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the\\nhardness\\nof the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh\\nday--do\\nye understand this contrast?  and that your sympathy for the\\n\"creature\\nin man\" applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised,\\nforged,\\nstretched, roasted, annealed, refined--to that which must\\nnecessarily\\nsuffer, and is meant to suffer?  and our sympathy--do ye\\nnot understand\\nwhat our reverse sympathy applies to, when it resists\\nyour sympathy as\\nthe worst of all pampering and enervation?--so it is\\nsympathy against\\nsympathy!--but to repeat it once more, there are\\nhigher problems than\\nthe problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy;\\nand all systems of\\nphilosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.\\n226. we immoralists.--this world with which we are concerned, in which\\nwe have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of\\ndelicate command and delicate obedience, a world of \"almost\" in every\\nrespect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender--yes, it is well\\nprotected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity!  we are\\nwoven\\ninto a strong net and garment of duties, and cannot disengage\\nourselves--precisely here, we are \"men of duty,\" even we!\\noccasionally,\\nit is true, we dance in our \"chains\" and betwixt our\\n\"swords\"; it\\nis none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth\\nunder the\\ncircumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of\\nour lot.  but\\ndo what we will, fools and appearances say of us: \"these\\nare men without\\nduty,\"--we have always fools and appearances against\\nus!\\n\\n227. honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot\\nrid\\nourselves, we free spirits--well, we will labour at it with all\\nour\\nperversity and love, and not tire of \"perfecting\" ourselves in our\\nvirtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like\\na\\ngilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull\\ngloomy seriousness!  and if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day\\ngrow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and\\nwould fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable\\nvice, let us remain hard, we latest stoics, and let us send to its\\nhelp whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsy\\nand\\nundefined, our \"nitimur in vetitum,\" our love of adventure,\\nour\\nsharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,\\nintellectual will to power and universal conquest, which rambles and\\nroves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with\\nall\\nour \"devils\" to the help of our \"god\"! it is probable that people\\nwill\\nmisunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it\\nmatter!  they\\nwill say: \"their \\'honesty\\'--that is their devilry, and\\nnothing else!\"\\nwhat does it matter!  and even if they were right--have\\nnot all gods\\nhitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils?  and\\nafter all, what\\ndo we know of ourselves?  and what the spirit that\\nleads us wants to be\\ncalled?  (it is a question of names.) and how\\nmany spirits we harbour?\\nour honesty, we free spirits--let us be\\ncareful lest it become our\\nvanity, our ornament and ostentation, our\\nlimitation, our stupidity!\\nevery virtue inclines to stupidity, every\\nstupidity to virtue; \"stupid\\nto the point of sanctity,\" they say in\\nrussia,--let us be careful lest\\nout of pure honesty we eventually\\nbecome saints and bores!  is not life\\na hundred times too short for us\\n--to bore ourselves?  one would have to\\nbelieve in eternal life in\\norder to...\\n\\n228. i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral\\nphilosophy\\nhitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific\\nappliances--and that \"virtue,\" in my opinion, has been more injured\\nby\\nthe tediousness of its advocates than by anything else; at the same\\ntime, however, i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness.\\nit\\nis desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon\\nmorals,\\nand consequently it is very desirable that morals should not\\nsome day\\nbecome interesting!  but let us not be afraid!  things still\\nremain today\\nas they have always been: i see no one in europe who has\\n(or discloses)\\nan idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning\\nmorals might be\\nconducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring\\nmanner--that calamity\\nmight be involved therein.  observe, for\\nexample, the indefatigable,\\ninevitable english utilitarians: how\\nponderously and respectably they\\nstalk on, stalk along (a homeric\\nmetaphor expresses it better) in the\\nfootsteps of bentham, just as he\\nhad already stalked in the footsteps of\\nthe respectable helvetius!\\n(no, he was not a dangerous man, helvetius,\\nce senateur pococurante,\\nto use an expression of galiani). no new\\nthought, nothing of the\\nnature of a finer turning or better expression\\nof an old thought, not\\neven a proper history of what has been previously\\nthought on the\\nsubject: an impossible literature, taking it all in all,\\nunless one\\nknows how to leaven it with some mischief.  in effect, the\\nold english\\nvice called cant, which is moral tartuffism, has insinuated\\nitself\\nalso into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an\\neye to\\ntheir motives if one must read them), concealed this time under\\nthe\\nnew form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent\\nfrom\\nthem a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a\\nrace\\nof former puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific\\ntinkering with morals.  (is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan?\\nthat is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable,\\nas\\nworthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem?  is moralizing\\nnot-\\nimmoral?) in the end, they all want english morality to be\\nrecognized\\nas authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the \"general\\nutility,\" or\\n\"the happiness of the greatest number,\"--no!  the happiness\\nof\\nengland, will be best served thereby.  they would like, by all means,\\nto convince themselves that the striving after english happiness, i\\nmean after comfort and fashion (and in the highest instance, a seat in\\nparliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact,\\nthat\\nin so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has\\njust consisted in such striving.  not one of those ponderous,\\nconscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the\\ncause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have\\nany\\nknowledge or inkling of the facts that the \"general welfare\" is\\nno\\nideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a\\nnostrum,--that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another,\\nthat the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to\\nhigher men, in short, that there is a distinction of rank between man\\nand man, and consequently between morality and morality.  they are an\\nunassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these\\nutilitarian\\nenglishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they\\nare tedious, one\\ncannot think highly enough of their utility.  one\\nought even to encourage\\nthem, as has been partially attempted in the\\nfollowing rhymes:--\\n\\n    hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,\\n\"longer--better,\" aye revealing,\\n\\n    stiffer aye in head and knee;\\nunenraptured, never jesting,\\n    mediocre everlasting,\\n\\n    sans genie\\net sans esprit!\\n\\n\\n229. in these later ages, which may be proud of\\ntheir humanity, there\\nstill remains so much fear, so much superstition\\nof the fear, of the\\n\"cruel wild beast,\" the mastering of which\\nconstitutes the very pride of\\nthese humaner ages--that even obvious\\ntruths, as if by the agreement\\nof centuries, have long remained\\nunuttered, because they have the\\nappearance of helping the finally\\nslain wild beast back to life again.\\ni perhaps risk something when i\\nallow such a truth to escape; let\\nothers capture it again and give it\\nso much \"milk of pious sentiment\"\\n[footnote: an expression from\\nschiller\\'s william tell, act iv, scene\\n3.] to drink, that it will lie\\ndown quiet and forgotten, in its old\\ncorner.--one ought to learn anew\\nabout cruelty, and open one\\'s eyes;\\none ought at last to learn\\nimpatience, in order that such immodest\\ngross errors--as, for\\ninstance, have been fostered by ancient and\\nmodern philosophers with\\nregard to tragedy--may no longer wander about\\nvirtuously and boldly.\\nalmost everything that we call \"higher culture\"\\nis based upon the\\nspiritualising and intensifying of cruelty--this is\\nmy thesis; the\\n\"wild beast\" has not been slain at all, it lives, it\\nflourishes, it\\nhas only been--transfigured.  that which constitutes the\\npainful\\ndelight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in\\nso-\\ncalled tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime,\\nup to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains\\nits\\nsweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty.\\nwhat the\\nroman enjoys in the arena, the christian in the ecstasies of\\nthe cross,\\nthe spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of\\nthe bull-fight,\\nthe present-day japanese who presses his way to the\\ntragedy, the workman\\nof the parisian suburbs who has a homesickness\\nfor bloody revolutions,\\nthe wagnerienne who, with unhinged will,\\n\"undergoes\" the performance of\\n\"tristan and isolde\"--what all these\\nenjoy, and strive with mysterious\\nardour to drink in, is the philtre\\nof the great circe \"cruelty.\"  here,\\nto be sure, we must put aside\\nentirely the blundering psychology of\\nformer times, which could only\\nteach with regard to cruelty that\\nit originated at the sight of the\\nsuffering of others: there is an\\nabundant, super-abundant enjoyment\\neven in one\\'s own suffering, in\\ncausing one\\'s own suffering--and\\nwherever man has allowed himself to be\\npersuaded to self-denial in the\\nreligious sense, or to self-mutilation,\\nas among the phoenicians and\\nascetics, or in general, to\\ndesensualisation, decarnalisation, and\\ncontrition, to puritanical\\nrepentance-spasms, to vivisection of\\nconscience and to pascal-like\\nsacrifizia dell\\' intelleto, he is\\nsecretly allured and impelled\\nforwards by his cruelty, by the\\ndangerous thrill of cruelty towards\\nhimself.--finally, let us consider\\nthat even the seeker of knowledge\\noperates as an artist and glorifier\\nof cruelty, in that he compels his\\nspirit to perceive against its own\\ninclination, and often enough against\\nthe wishes of his heart:--he\\nforces it to say nay, where he would like\\nto affirm, love, and adore;\\nindeed, every instance of taking a thing\\nprofoundly and fundamentally,\\nis a violation, an intentional injuring\\nof the fundamental will of the\\nspirit, which instinctively aims at\\nappearance and superficiality,--\\neven in every desire for knowledge there\\nis a drop of cruelty.\\n\\n230.\\nperhaps what i have said here about a \"fundamental will of the\\nspirit\"\\nmay not be understood without further details; i may be allowed\\na word\\nof explanation.--that imperious something which is popularly\\ncalled\\n\"the spirit,\" wishes to be master internally and externally,\\nand to\\nfeel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a\\nsimplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.\\nits requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned\\nby\\nphysiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies.  the\\npower\\nof the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in\\na strong\\ntendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the\\nmanifold,\\nto overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just\\nas it\\narbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for\\nitself\\ncertain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every\\nportion of\\nthe \"outside world.\"  its object thereby is the\\nincorporation of new\\n\"experiences,\" the assortment of new things in\\nthe old arrangements--in\\nshort, growth; or more properly, the feeling\\nof growth, the feeling of\\nincreased power--is its object.  this same\\nwill has at its service an\\napparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a\\nsuddenly adopted preference\\nof ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a\\nclosing of windows, an inner\\ndenial of this or that, a prohibition to\\napproach, a sort of defensive\\nattitude against much that is knowable,\\na contentment with obscurity,\\nwith the shutting-in horizon, an\\nacceptance and approval of ignorance:\\nas that which is all necessary\\naccording to the degree of its\\nappropriating power, its \"digestive\\npower,\" to speak figuratively (and\\nin fact \"the spirit\" resembles a\\nstomach more than anything else). here\\nalso belong an occasional\\npropensity of the spirit to let itself be\\ndeceived (perhaps with a\\nwaggish suspicion that it is not so and so,\\nbut is only allowed to\\npass as such), a delight in uncertainty and\\nambiguity, an exulting\\nenjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness\\nand mystery, of the\\ntoo-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,\\nthe diminished, the\\nmisshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the\\narbitrariness of all\\nthese manifestations of power.  finally, in this\\nconnection, there is\\nthe not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to\\ndeceive other spirits\\nand dissemble before them--the constant pressing\\nand straining of a\\ncreating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit\\nenjoys therein its\\ncraftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys\\nalso its feeling of\\nsecurity therein--it is precisely by its protean\\narts that it is best\\nprotected and concealed!--counter to this\\npropensity for appearance,\\nfor simplification, for a disguise, for a\\ncloak, in short, for an\\noutside--for every outside is a cloak--there\\noperates the sublime\\ntendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and\\ninsists on taking\\nthings profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a\\nkind of cruelty of\\nthe intellectual conscience and taste, which every\\ncourageous thinker\\nwill acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought\\nto be, that he has\\nsharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for\\nintrospection,\\nand is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe\\nwords.  he will\\nsay: \"there is something cruel in the tendency of my\\nspirit\": let the\\nvirtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not\\nso!  in fact,\\nit would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps\\nour\\n\"extravagant honesty\" were talked about, whispered about, and\\nglorified--we free, very free spirits--and some day perhaps such will\\nactually be our--posthumous glory!  meanwhile--for there is plenty of\\ntime until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in\\nsuch florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has\\njust\\nmade us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance.  they are\\nbeautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of\\ntruth,\\nlove of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the\\ntruthful--there\\nis something in them that makes one\\'s heart swell with\\npride.  but we\\nanchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded\\nourselves in all the\\nsecrecy of an anchorite\\'s conscience, that this\\nworthy parade of\\nverbiage also belongs to the old false adornment,\\nfrippery, and\\ngold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even\\nunder such\\nflattering colour and repainting, the terrible original\\ntext homo natura\\nmust again be recognized.  in effect, to translate\\nman back again into\\nnature; to master the many vain and visionary\\ninterpretations and\\nsubordinate meanings which have hitherto been\\nscratched and daubed over\\nthe eternal original text, homo natura; to\\nbring it about that man shall\\nhenceforth stand before man as he now,\\nhardened by the discipline\\nof science, stands before the other forms\\nof nature, with fearless\\noedipus-eyes, and stopped ulysses-ears, deaf\\nto the enticements of old\\nmetaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped\\nto him far too long: \"thou\\nart more!  thou art higher!  thou hast a\\ndifferent origin!\"--this may be\\na strange and foolish task, but that\\nit is a task, who can deny!  why did\\nwe choose it, this foolish task?\\nor, to put the question differently:\\n\"why knowledge at all?\"  every\\none will ask us about this.  and thus\\npressed, we, who have asked\\nourselves the question a hundred times, have\\nnot found and cannot find\\nany better answer....\\n\\n231. learning alters us, it does what all\\nnourishment does that does not\\nmerely \"conserve\"--as the physiologist\\nknows.  but at the bottom of our\\nsouls, quite \"down below,\" there is\\ncertainly something unteachable,\\na granite of spiritual fate, of\\npredetermined decision and answer to\\npredetermined, chosen questions.\\nin each cardinal problem there speaks\\nan unchangeable \"i am this\"; a\\nthinker cannot learn anew about man and\\nwoman, for instance, but can\\nonly learn fully--he can only follow to the\\nend what is \"fixed\" about\\nthem in himself.  occasionally we find certain\\nsolutions of problems\\nwhich make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they\\nare henceforth called\\n\"convictions.\"  later on--one sees in them only\\nfootsteps to self-\\nknowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we\\nourselves are--or more\\ncorrectly to the great stupidity which we embody,\\nour spiritual fate,\\nthe unteachable in us, quite \"down below.\"--in view\\nof this liberal\\ncompliment which i have just paid myself, permission\\nwill perhaps be\\nmore readily allowed me to utter some truths about\\n\"woman as she is,\"\\nprovided that it is known at the outset how literally\\nthey are merely\\n--my truths.\\n\\n232. woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she\\nbegins to\\nenlighten men about \"woman as she is\"--this is one of the\\nworst\\ndevelopments of the general uglifying of europe.  for what must\\nthese\\nclumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure\\nbring\\nto light!  woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is\\nso\\nmuch pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty\\npresumption,\\nunbridledness, and indiscretion concealed--study only\\nwoman\\'s behaviour\\ntowards children!--which has really been best\\nrestrained and dominated\\nhitherto by the fear of man.  alas, if ever\\nthe \"eternally tedious in\\nwoman\"--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to\\nventure forth!  if she\\nbegins radically and on principle to unlearn\\nher wisdom and art-of\\ncharming, of playing, of frightening away\\nsorrow, of alleviating and\\ntaking easily; if she forgets her delicate\\naptitude for agreeable\\ndesires!  female voices are already raised,\\nwhich, by saint aristophanes!\\nmake one afraid:--with medical\\nexplicitness it is stated in a\\nthreatening manner what woman first and\\nlast requires from man.  is\\nit not in the very worst taste that woman\\nthus sets herself up to be\\nscientific?  enlightenment hitherto has\\nfortunately been men\\'s affair,\\nmen\\'s gift--we remained therewith\\n\"among ourselves\"; and in the end,\\nin view of all that women write\\nabout \"woman,\" we may well have\\nconsiderable doubt as to whether woman\\nreally desires enlightenment\\nabout herself--and can desire it.  if\\nwoman does not thereby seek a new\\nornament for herself--i believe\\nornamentation belongs to the eternally\\nfeminine?--why, then, she\\nwishes to make herself feared: perhaps she\\nthereby wishes to get the\\nmastery.  but she does not want truth--what\\ndoes woman care for truth?\\nfrom the very first, nothing is more foreign,\\nmore repugnant, or more\\nhostile to woman than truth--her great art is\\nfalsehood, her chief\\nconcern is appearance and beauty.  let us confess\\nit, we men: we\\nhonour and love this very art and this very instinct in\\nwoman: we who\\nhave the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the\\ncompany of\\nbeings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our\\nseriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to\\nus.  finally, i ask the question: did a woman herself ever acknowledge\\nprofundity in a woman\\'s mind, or justice in a woman\\'s heart?  and is\\nit\\nnot true that on the whole \"woman\" has hitherto been most despised\\nby\\nwoman herself, and not at all by us?--we men desire that woman\\nshould\\nnot continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as\\nit was\\nman\\'s care and the consideration for woman, when the church\\ndecreed:\\nmulier taceat in ecclesia.  it was to the benefit of woman\\nwhen napoleon\\ngave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand:\\nmulier taceat in\\npoliticis!--and in my opinion, he is a true friend of\\nwoman who calls\\nout to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.\\n\\n233.\\nit betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact that\\nit\\nbetrays bad taste--when a woman refers to madame roland, or madame de\\nstael, or monsieur george sand, as though something were proved\\nthereby\\nin favour of \"woman as she is.\"  among men, these are the\\nthree comical\\nwomen as they are--nothing more!--and just the best\\ninvoluntary\\ncounter-arguments against feminine emancipation and\\nautonomy.\\n\\n234. stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible\\nthoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of\\nthe house is managed!  woman does not understand what food means, and\\nshe\\ninsists on being cook!  if woman had been a thinking creature, she\\nshould\\ncertainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the\\nmost\\nimportant physiological facts, and should likewise have got\\npossession\\nof the healing art!  through bad female cooks--through the\\nentire lack\\nof reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has\\nbeen longest\\nretarded and most interfered with: even today matters are\\nvery little\\nbetter.  a word to high school girls.\\n\\n235. there are\\nturns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little\\nhandfuls of\\nwords, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly\\ncrystallises\\nitself.  among these is the incidental remark of madame de\\nlambert to\\nher son: \"mon ami, ne vous permettez jamais que des folies,\\nqui vous\\nferont grand plaisir\"--the motherliest and wisest remark, by\\nthe way,\\nthat was ever addressed to a son.\\n\\n236. i have no doubt that every\\nnoble woman will oppose what dante and\\ngoethe believed about woman--\\nthe former when he sang, \"ella guardava\\nsuso, ed io in lei,\" and the\\nlatter when he interpreted it, \"the\\neternally feminine draws us\\naloft\"; for this is just what she believes\\nof the eternally masculine.\\n237.\\n\\nseven apophthegms for women\\n\\nhow the longest ennui flees, when a\\nman comes to our knees!\\n\\nage, alas!  and science staid, furnish even\\nweak virtue aid.\\n\\nsombre garb and silence meet: dress for every dame--\\ndiscreet.\\n\\nwhom i thank when in my bliss?  god!--and my good\\ntailoress!\\n\\nyoung, a flower-decked cavern home; old, a dragon thence\\ndoth roam.\\n\\nnoble title, leg that\\'s fine, man as well: oh, were he\\nmine!\\n\\nspeech in brief and sense in mass--slippery for the jenny-ass!\\n237a.  woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which,\\nlosing\\ntheir way, have come down among them from an elevation: as\\nsomething\\ndelicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating--but\\nas something\\nalso which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.\\n238. to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of \"man and woman,\" to\\ndeny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an\\neternally\\nhostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights,\\nequal\\ntraining, equal claims and obligations: that is a typical sign\\nof\\nshallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at\\nthis dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded\\nas\\nsuspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably\\nprove\\ntoo \"short\" for all fundamental questions of life, future as\\nwell as\\npresent, and will be unable to descend into any of the depths.\\non the\\nother hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of\\ndesires, and\\nhas also the depth of benevolence which is capable of\\nseverity and\\nharshness, and easily confounded with them, can only\\nthink of woman as\\norientals do: he must conceive of her as a\\npossession, as confinable\\nproperty, as a being predestined for service\\nand accomplishing her\\nmission therein--he must take his stand in this\\nmatter upon the immense\\nrationality of asia, upon the superiority of\\nthe instinct of asia, as\\nthe greeks did formerly; those best heirs and\\nscholars of asia--who,\\nas is well known, with their increasing culture\\nand amplitude of power,\\nfrom homer to the time of pericles, became\\ngradually stricter towards\\nwoman, in short, more oriental.  how\\nnecessary, how logical, even how\\nhumanely desirable this was, let us\\nconsider for ourselves!\\n\\n239. the weaker sex has in no previous age\\nbeen treated with so\\nmuch respect by men as at present--this belongs\\nto the tendency and\\nfundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as\\ndisrespectfulness to\\nold age--what wonder is it that abuse should be\\nimmediately made of\\nthis respect?  they want more, they learn to make\\nclaims, the tribute\\nof respect is at last felt to be well-nigh\\ngalling; rivalry for rights,\\nindeed actual strife itself, would be\\npreferred: in a word, woman is\\nlosing modesty.  and let us immediately\\nadd that she is also losing\\ntaste.  she is unlearning to fear man: but\\nthe woman who \"unlearns to\\nfear\" sacrifices her most womanly\\ninstincts.  that woman should venture\\nforward when the fear-inspiring\\nquality in man--or more definitely,\\nthe man in man--is no longer\\neither desired or fully developed, is\\nreasonable enough and also\\nintelligible enough; what is more difficult\\nto understand is that\\nprecisely thereby--woman deteriorates.  this is\\nwhat is happening\\nnowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!\\nwherever the\\nindustrial spirit has triumphed over the military\\nand aristocratic\\nspirit, woman strives for the economic and legal\\nindependence of a\\nclerk: \"woman as clerkess\" is inscribed on the portal\\nof the modern\\nsociety which is in course of formation.  while she\\nthus appropriates\\nnew rights, aspires to be \"master,\" and inscribes\\n\"progress\" of woman\\non her flags and banners, the very opposite realises\\nitself with\\nterrible obviousness: woman retrogrades.  since the french\\nrevolution\\nthe influence of woman in europe has declined in proportion\\nas she has\\nincreased her rights and claims; and the \"emancipation of\\nwoman,\"\\ninsofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and\\nnot\\nonly by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable\\nsymptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly\\ninstincts.  there is stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine\\nstupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible\\nwoman--might be heartily ashamed.  to lose the intuition as to the\\nground\\nupon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect\\nexercise in\\nthe use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before\\nman, perhaps\\neven \"to the book,\" where formerly she kept herself in\\ncontrol and in\\nrefined, artful humility; to neutralize with her\\nvirtuous audacity man\\'s\\nfaith in a veiled, fundamentally different\\nideal in woman, something\\neternally, necessarily feminine; to\\nemphatically and loquaciously\\ndissuade man from the idea that woman\\nmust be preserved, cared for,\\nprotected, and indulged, like some\\ndelicate, strangely wild, and\\noften pleasant domestic animal; the\\nclumsy and indignant collection of\\neverything of the nature of\\nservitude and bondage which the position of\\nwoman in the hitherto\\nexisting order of society has entailed and still\\nentails (as though\\nslavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a\\ncondition of every\\nhigher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what\\ndoes all this\\nbetoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts,\\na defeminising?\\ncertainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and\\ncorrupters of woman\\namong the learned asses of the masculine sex, who\\nadvise woman to\\ndefeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate\\nall the stupidities\\nfrom which \"man\" in europe, european \"manliness,\"\\nsuffers,--who would\\nlike to lower woman to \"general culture,\" indeed\\neven to newspaper\\nreading and meddling with politics.  here and there\\nthey wish even to\\nmake women into free spirits and literary workers: as\\nthough a woman\\nwithout piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious\\nor ludicrous\\nto a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her\\nnerves are being\\nruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music\\n(our latest\\ngerman music), and she is daily being made more hysterical\\nand more\\nincapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of\\nbearing\\nrobust children.  they wish to \"cultivate\" her in general still\\nmore,\\nand intend, as they say, to make the \"weaker sex\" strong by\\nculture:\\nas if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that\\nthe\\n\"cultivating\" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the\\nweakening, dissipating, and languishing of his force of will--have\\nalways kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and\\ninfluential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of napoleon)\\nhad just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--\\nfor\\ntheir power and ascendancy over men.  that which inspires respect\\nin woman, and often enough fear also, is her nature, which is more\\n\"natural\" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning\\nflexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her naivete in egoism,\\nher untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness,\\nextent, and deviation of her desires and virtues.  that which, in\\nspite\\nof fear, excites one\\'s sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful\\ncat,\\n\"woman,\" is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more\\nnecessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any\\nother creature.  fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man\\nhas\\nhitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot\\nalready in\\ntragedy, which rends while it delights--what?  and all that\\nis now to\\nbe at an end?  and the disenchantment of woman is in\\nprogress?  the\\ntediousness of woman is slowly evolving?  oh europe!\\neurope!  we know\\nthe horned animal which was always most attractive to\\nthee, from which\\ndanger is ever again threatening thee!  thy old fable\\nmight once more\\nbecome \"history\"--an immense stupidity might once\\nagain overmaster\\nthee and carry thee away!  and no god concealed\\nbeneath it--no!  only an\\n\"idea,\" a \"modern idea\"!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii.\\npeoples and countries\\n\\n\\n240. i heard, once again for the first time,\\nrichard wagner\\'s overture\\nto the mastersinger: it is a piece of\\nmagnificent, gorgeous, heavy,\\nlatter-day art, which has the pride to\\npresuppose two centuries of music\\nas still living, in order that it\\nmay be understood:--it is an honour\\nto germans that such a pride did\\nnot miscalculate!  what flavours\\nand forces, what seasons and climes\\ndo we not find mingled in it!  it\\nimpresses us at one time as ancient,\\nat another time as foreign, bitter,\\nand too modern, it is as arbitrary\\nas it is pompously traditional, it\\nis not infrequently roguish, still\\noftener rough and coarse--it has fire\\nand courage, and at the same\\ntime the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits\\nwhich ripen too late.  it\\nflows broad and full: and suddenly there is a\\nmoment of inexplicable\\nhesitation, like a gap that opens between cause\\nand effect, an\\noppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but\\nalready it\\nbroadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most\\nmanifold\\ndelight,--of old and new happiness; including especially\\nthe joy of\\nthe artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his\\nastonished,\\nhappy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here\\nemployed, the\\nnew, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art\\nwhich he\\napparently betrays to us.  all in all, however, no beauty, no\\nsouth,\\nnothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing\\nof\\ngrace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even,\\nwhich is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us:\\n\"it\\nis part of my intention\"; a cumbersome drapery, something\\narbitrarily\\nbarbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and\\nvenerable conceits\\nand witticisms; something german in the best and\\nworst sense of\\nthe word, something in the german style, manifold,\\nformless, and\\ninexhaustible; a certain german potency and super-\\nplenitude of\\nsoul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the\\nraffinements of\\ndecadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease\\nthere; a real,\\ngenuine token of the german soul, which is at the same\\ntime young and\\naged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity.\\nthis kind of music\\nexpresses best what i think of the germans: they\\nbelong to the day\\nbefore yesterday and the day after tomorrow--they\\nhave as yet no today.\\n\\n241. we \"good europeans,\" we also have hours\\nwhen we allow ourselves a\\nwarm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and\\nrelapse into old loves and narrow\\nviews--i have just given an example\\nof it--hours of national excitement,\\nof patriotic anguish, and all\\nother sorts of old-fashioned floods of\\nsentiment.  duller spirits may\\nperhaps only get done with what confines\\nits operations in us to hours\\nand plays itself out in hours--in a\\nconsiderable time: some in half a\\nyear, others in half a lifetime,\\naccording to the speed and strength\\nwith which they digest and \"change\\ntheir material.\"  indeed, i could\\nthink of sluggish, hesitating races,\\nwhich even in our rapidly moving\\neurope, would require half a century\\nere they could surmount such\\natavistic attacks of patriotism and\\nsoil-attachment, and return once\\nmore to reason, that is to say, to\\n\"good europeanism.\"  and while\\ndigressing on this possibility, i\\nhappen to become an ear-witness of a\\nconversation between two old\\npatriots--they were evidently both hard\\nof hearing and consequently\\nspoke all the louder.  \"he has as much,\\nand knows as much, philosophy as\\na peasant or a corps-student,\" said\\nthe one--\"he is still innocent.  but\\nwhat does that matter nowadays!\\nit is the age of the masses: they lie on\\ntheir belly before everything\\nthat is massive.  and so also in politicis.\\na statesman who rears up\\nfor them a new tower of babel, some monstrosity\\nof empire and power,\\nthey call \\'great\\'--what does it matter that we more\\nprudent and\\nconservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief\\nthat it is\\nonly the great thought that gives greatness to an action or\\naffair.\\nsupposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position\\nof\\nbeing obliged henceforth to practise \\'high politics,\\' for which they\\nwere by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have\\nto\\nsacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and\\ndoubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people\\ngenerally to \\'practise politics,\\' when they have hitherto had\\nsomething\\nbetter to do and think about, and when in the depths of\\ntheir souls\\nthey have been unable to free themselves from a prudent\\nloathing of\\nthe restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the\\nessentially\\npolitics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman\\nwere to\\nstimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people,\\nwere to\\nmake a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in\\naloofness,\\nan offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency,\\nwere to\\ndepreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their\\nconsciences,\\nmake their minds narrow, and their tastes \\'national\\'--\\nwhat!  a statesman\\nwho should do all this, which his people would have\\nto do penance for\\nthroughout their whole future, if they had a future,\\nsuch a statesman\\nwould be great, would he?\"--\"undoubtedly!\"  replied\\nthe other old patriot\\nvehemently, \"otherwise he could not have done\\nit!  it was mad perhaps to\\nwish such a thing!  but perhaps everything\\ngreat has been just as mad\\nat its commencement!\"--\"misuse of words!\"\\ncried his interlocutor,\\ncontradictorily--\"strong!  strong!  strong and\\nmad!  not great!\"--the old\\nmen had obviously become heated as they\\nthus shouted their \"truths\" in\\neach other\\'s faces, but i, in my\\nhappiness and apartness, considered how\\nsoon a stronger one may become\\nmaster of the strong, and also that\\nthere is a compensation for the\\nintellectual superficialising of a\\nnation--namely, in the deepening of\\nanother.\\n\\n242. whether we call it \"civilization,\" or \"humanising,\" or\\n\"progress,\"\\nwhich now distinguishes the european, whether we call it\\nsimply, without\\npraise or blame, by the political formula the\\ndemocratic movement in\\neurope--behind all the moral and political\\nforegrounds pointed to by\\nsuch formulas, an immense physiological\\nprocess goes on, which is ever\\nextending the process of the\\nassimilation of europeans, their\\nincreasing detachment from the\\nconditions under which, climatically and\\nhereditarily, united races\\noriginate, their increasing independence of\\nevery definite milieu,\\nthat for centuries would fain inscribe itself\\nwith equal demands on\\nsoul and body,--that is to say, the slow emergence\\nof an essentially\\nsuper-national and nomadic species of man, who\\npossesses,\\nphysiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power\\nof adaptation\\nas his typical distinction.  this process of the evolving\\neuropean,\\nwhich can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses, but\\nwill perhaps\\njust gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the\\nstill-raging\\nstorm and stress of \"national sentiment\" pertains to it,\\nand also the\\nanarchism which is appearing at present--this process\\nwill probably\\narrive at results on which its naive propagators and\\npanegyrists, the\\napostles of \"modern ideas,\" would least care to reckon.\\nthe same new\\nconditions under which on an average a levelling and\\nmediocrising of\\nman will take place--a useful, industrious, variously\\nserviceable, and\\nclever gregarious man--are in the highest degree\\nsuitable to give rise\\nto exceptional men of the most dangerous and\\nattractive qualities.\\nfor, while the capacity for adaptation, which is\\nevery day trying\\nchanging conditions, and begins a new work with every\\ngeneration,\\nalmost with every decade, makes the powerfulness of the type\\nimpossible; while the collective impression of such future europeans\\nwill probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very\\nhandy workmen who require a master, a commander, as they require their\\ndaily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of europe will tend\\nto\\nthe production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtle\\nsense of the term: the strong man will necessarily in individual and\\nexceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever\\nbeen before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to\\nthe immense variety of practice, art, and disguise.  i meant to say\\nthat the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary\\narrangement for the rearing of tyrants--taking the word in all its\\nmeanings, even in its most spiritual sense.\\n\\n243. i hear with pleasure\\nthat our sun is moving rapidly towards the\\nconstellation hercules: and\\ni hope that the men on this earth will do\\nlike the sun.  and we\\nforemost, we good europeans!\\n\\n244. there was a time when it was\\ncustomary to call germans \"deep\"\\nby way of distinction; but now that\\nthe most successful type of new\\ngermanism is covetous of quite other\\nhonours, and perhaps misses\\n\"smartness\" in all that has depth, it is\\nalmost opportune and patriotic\\nto doubt whether we did not formerly\\ndeceive ourselves with that\\ncommendation: in short, whether german\\ndepth is not at bottom something\\ndifferent and worse--and something\\nfrom which, thank god, we are on the\\npoint of successfully ridding\\nourselves.  let us try, then, to relearn\\nwith regard to german depth;\\nthe only thing necessary for the purpose is\\na little vivisection of\\nthe german soul.--the german soul is above all\\nmanifold, varied in its\\nsource, aggregated and super-imposed, rather\\nthan actually built: this\\nis owing to its origin.  a german who would\\nembolden himself to\\nassert: \"two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,\" would\\nmake a bad guess\\nat the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far\\nshort of the truth\\nabout the number of souls.  as a people made up of\\nthe most\\nextraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a\\npreponderance of the pre-aryan element as the \"people of the centre\"\\nin\\nevery sense of the term, the germans are more intangible, more\\nample,\\nmore contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more\\nsurprising,\\nand even more terrifying than other peoples are to\\nthemselves:--they\\nescape definition, and are thereby alone the despair\\nof the french.  it\\nis characteristic of the germans that the question:\\n\"what is german?\"\\nnever dies out among them.  kotzebue certainly knew\\nhis germans well\\nenough: \"we are known,\" they cried jubilantly to him\\n--but sand also\\nthought he knew them.  jean paul knew what he was\\ndoing when he declared\\nhimself incensed at fichte\\'s lying but\\npatriotic flatteries and\\nexaggerations,--but it is probable that\\ngoethe thought differently about\\ngermans from jean paul, even though\\nhe acknowledged him to be right with\\nregard to fichte.  it is a\\nquestion what goethe really thought about the\\ngermans?--but about many\\nthings around him he never spoke explicitly,\\nand all his life he knew\\nhow to keep an astute silence--probably he\\nhad good reason for it.  it\\nis certain that it was not the \"wars of\\nindependence\" that made him\\nlook up more joyfully, any more than it was\\nthe french revolution,--\\nthe event on account of which he reconstructed\\nhis \"faust,\" and indeed\\nthe whole problem of \"man,\" was the appearance\\nof napoleon.  there are\\nwords of goethe in which he condemns with\\nimpatient severity, as from\\na foreign land, that which germans take a\\npride in, he once defined\\nthe famous german turn of mind as \"indulgence\\ntowards its own and\\nothers\\' weaknesses.\"  was he wrong?  it is\\ncharacteristic of germans\\nthat one is seldom entirely wrong about them.\\nthe german soul has\\npassages and galleries in it, there are caves,\\nhiding-places, and\\ndungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm\\nof the\\nmysterious, the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to\\nchaos.\\nand as everything loves its symbol, so the german loves the\\nclouds and\\nall that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and\\nshrouded, it\\nseems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped,\\nself-displacing,\\nand growing is \"deep\". the german himself does not\\nexist, he is\\nbecoming, he is \"developing himself\". \"development\" is\\ntherefore the\\nessentially german discovery and hit in the great domain\\nof\\nphilosophical formulas,--a ruling idea, which, together with german\\nbeer and german music, is labouring to germanise all europe.\\nforeigners\\nare astonished and attracted by the riddles which the\\nconflicting nature\\nat the basis of the german soul propounds to them\\n(riddles which\\nhegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end\\nset to music).\\n\"good-natured and spiteful\"--such a juxtaposition,\\npreposterous in the\\ncase of every other people, is unfortunately only\\ntoo often justified\\nin germany one has only to live for a while among\\nswabians to know this!\\nthe clumsiness of the german scholar and his\\nsocial distastefulness\\nagree alarmingly well with his physical rope-\\ndancing and nimble\\nboldness, of which all the gods have learnt to be\\nafraid.  if any one\\nwishes to see the \"german soul\" demonstrated ad\\noculos, let him\\nonly look at german taste, at german arts and manners\\nwhat boorish\\nindifference to \"taste\"! how the noblest and the\\ncommonest stand there\\nin juxtaposition!  how disorderly and how rich\\nis the whole constitution\\nof this soul!  the german drags at his soul,\\nhe drags at everything he\\nexperiences.  he digests his events badly;\\nhe never gets \"done\"\\nwith them; and german depth is often only a\\ndifficult, hesitating\\n\"digestion.\"  and just as all chronic invalids,\\nall dyspeptics like what\\nis convenient, so the german loves\\n\"frankness\" and \"honesty\"; it is\\nso convenient to be frank and honest!\\n--this confidingness, this\\ncomplaisance, this showing-the-cards of\\ngerman honesty, is probably the\\nmost dangerous and most successful\\ndisguise which the german is up to\\nnowadays: it is his proper\\nmephistophelean art; with this he can \"still\\nachieve much\"! the german\\nlets himself go, and thereby gazes with\\nfaithful, blue, empty german\\neyes--and other countries immediately\\nconfound him with his dressing-\\ngown!--i meant to say that, let \"german\\ndepth\" be what it will--among\\nourselves alone we perhaps take the\\nliberty to laugh at it--we shall\\ndo well to continue henceforth to\\nhonour its appearance and good name,\\nand not barter away too cheaply our\\nold reputation as a people of\\ndepth for prussian \"smartness,\" and\\nberlin wit and sand.  it is wise\\nfor a people to pose, and let itself\\nbe regarded, as profound, clumsy,\\ngood-natured, honest, and foolish: it\\nmight even be--profound to do\\nso!  finally, we should do honour to\\nour name--we are not called the\\n\"tiusche volk\" (deceptive people) for\\nnothing....\\n\\n245. the \"good old\"\\ntime is past, it sang itself out in mozart--how\\nhappy are we that his\\nrococo still speaks to us, that his \"good\\ncompany,\" his tender\\nenthusiasm, his childish delight in the chinese and\\nits flourishes,\\nhis courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the\\namorous, the\\ntripping, the tearful, and his belief in the south, can\\nstill appeal\\nto something left in us!  ah, some time or other it will be\\nover with\\nit!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with\\nthe\\nintelligence and taste for beethoven!  for he was only the last echo\\nof a break and transition in style, and not, like mozart, the last\\necho\\nof a great european taste which had existed for centuries.\\nbeethoven\\nis the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is\\nconstantly\\nbreaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always\\ncoming;\\nthere is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss\\nand eternal\\nextravagant hope,--the same light in which europe was\\nbathed when it\\ndreamed with rousseau, when it danced round the tree of\\nliberty of the\\nrevolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration\\nbefore napoleon.\\nbut how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale,\\nhow difficult\\nnowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment, how\\nstrangely does\\nthe language of rousseau, schiller, shelley, and byron\\nsound to our ear,\\nin whom collectively the same fate of europe was\\nable to speak, which\\nknew how to sing in beethoven!--whatever german\\nmusic came afterwards,\\nbelongs to romanticism, that is to say, to a\\nmovement which,\\nhistorically considered, was still shorter, more\\nfleeting, and more\\nsuperficial than that great interlude, the\\ntransition of europe from\\nrousseau to napoleon, and to the rise of\\ndemocracy.  weber--but what do\\nwe care nowadays for \"freischutz\" and\\n\"oberon\"! or marschner\\'s \"hans\\nheiling\" and \"vampyre\"! or even\\nwagner\\'s \"tannhauser\"! that is extinct,\\nalthough not yet forgotten\\nmusic.  this whole music of romanticism,\\nbesides, was not noble\\nenough, was not musical enough, to maintain its\\nposition anywhere but\\nin the theatre and before the masses; from the\\nbeginning it was\\nsecond-rate music, which was little thought of by\\ngenuine musicians.\\nit was different with felix mendelssohn, that halcyon\\nmaster, who, on\\naccount of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly\\nacquired\\nadmiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful\\nepisode of german music.  but with regard to robert schumann, who took\\nthings seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first--he\\nwas\\nthe last that founded a school,--do we not now regard it as a\\nsatisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very romanticism\\nof\\nschumann\\'s has been surmounted?  schumann, fleeing into the \"saxon\\nswitzerland\" of his soul, with a half werther-like, half jean-paul-\\nlike\\nnature (assuredly not like beethoven!  assuredly not like\\nbyron!)--his\\nmanfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the\\nextent of\\ninjustice; schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally\\na petty\\ntaste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly\\ndangerous among\\ngermans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the\\nfeelings), going\\nconstantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a\\nnoble weakling who\\nrevelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow,\\nfrom the beginning\\na sort of girl and noli me tangere--this schumann\\nwas already merely a\\ngerman event in music, and no longer a european\\nevent, as beethoven had\\nbeen, as in a still greater degree mozart had\\nbeen; with schumann german\\nmusic was threatened with its greatest\\ndanger, that of losing the voice\\nfor the soul of europe and sinking\\ninto a merely national affair.\\n\\n246. what a torture are books written\\nin german to a reader who has a\\nthird ear!  how indignantly he stands\\nbeside the slowly turning swamp\\nof sounds without tune and rhythms\\nwithout dance, which germans call\\na \"book\"! and even the german who\\nreads books!  how lazily, how\\nreluctantly, how badly he reads!  how\\nmany germans know, and consider it\\nobligatory to know, that there is\\nart in every good sentence--art which\\nmust be divined, if the sentence\\nis to be understood!  if there is a\\nmisunderstanding about its tempo,\\nfor instance, the sentence itself\\nis misunderstood!  that one must not\\nbe doubtful about the\\nrhythm-determining syllables, that one should\\nfeel the breaking of the\\ntoo-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a\\ncharm, that one should lend a\\nfine and patient ear to every staccato\\nand every rubato, that one should\\ndivine the sense in the sequence of\\nthe vowels and diphthongs, and how\\ndelicately and richly they can be\\ntinted and retinted in the order of\\ntheir arrangement--who among book-\\nreading germans is complaisant enough\\nto recognize such duties and\\nrequirements, and to listen to so much art\\nand intention in language?\\nafter all, one just \"has no ear for it\";\\nand so the most marked\\ncontrasts of style are not heard, and the most\\ndelicate artistry is as\\nit were squandered on the deaf.--these were my\\nthoughts when i noticed\\nhow clumsily and unintuitively two masters in\\nthe art of prose-writing\\nhave been confounded: one, whose words drop\\ndown hesitatingly and\\ncoldly, as from the roof of a damp cave--he counts\\non their dull sound\\nand echo; and another who manipulates his language\\nlike a flexible\\nsword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the\\ndangerous bliss\\nof the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to\\nbite, hiss, and\\ncut.\\n\\n247. how little the german style has to do with harmony and with\\nthe\\near, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians\\nthemselves\\nwrite badly.  the german does not read aloud, he does not\\nread for the\\near, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in\\nthe drawer for\\nthe time.  in antiquity when a man read--which was\\nseldom enough--he read\\nsomething to himself, and in a loud voice; they\\nwere surprised when\\nany one read silently, and sought secretly the\\nreason of it.  in a\\nloud voice: that is to say, with all the\\nswellings, inflections, and\\nvariations of key and changes of tempo, in\\nwhich the ancient public\\nworld took delight.  the laws of the written\\nstyle were then the same\\nas those of the spoken style; and these laws\\ndepended partly on the\\nsurprising development and refined requirements\\nof the ear and larynx;\\npartly on the strength, endurance, and power of\\nthe ancient lungs.  in\\nthe ancient sense, a period is above all a\\nphysiological whole, inasmuch\\nas it is comprised in one breath.  such\\nperiods as occur in demosthenes\\nand cicero, swelling twice and sinking\\ntwice, and all in one breath,\\nwere pleasures to the men of antiquity,\\nwho knew by their own schooling\\nhow to appreciate the virtue therein,\\nthe rareness and the difficulty\\nin the deliverance of such a\\nperiod;--we have really no right to the\\nbig period, we modern men, who\\nare short of breath in every sense!  those\\nancients, indeed, were all\\nof them dilettanti in speaking, consequently\\nconnoisseurs,\\nconsequently critics--they thus brought their orators to\\nthe highest\\npitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all\\nitalian\\nladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song\\n(and\\nwith it also the art of melody) reached its elevation.  in germany,\\nhowever (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began\\nshyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was\\nproperly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical\\ndiscourse--that delivered from the pulpit.  the preacher was the only\\none\\nin germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what\\nmanner a\\nsentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a\\nclose; he alone\\nhad a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad\\nconscience: for reasons\\nare not lacking why proficiency in oratory\\nshould be especially seldom\\nattained by a german, or almost always too\\nlate.  the masterpiece of\\ngerman prose is therefore with good reason\\nthe masterpiece of its\\ngreatest preacher: the bible has hitherto been\\nthe best german\\nbook.  compared with luther\\'s bible, almost everything\\nelse is merely\\n\"literature\"--something which has not grown in germany,\\nand therefore\\nhas not taken and does not take root in german hearts,\\nas the bible has\\ndone.\\n\\n248. there are two kinds of geniuses: one\\nwhich above all engenders and\\nseeks to engender, and another which\\nwillingly lets itself be fructified\\nand brings forth.  and similarly,\\namong the gifted nations, there are\\nthose on whom the woman\\'s problem\\nof pregnancy has devolved, and the\\nsecret task of forming, maturing,\\nand perfecting--the greeks, for\\ninstance, were a nation of this kind,\\nand so are the french; and others\\nwhich have to fructify and become\\nthe cause of new modes of life--like\\nthe jews, the romans, and, in all\\nmodesty be it asked: like the\\ngermans?--nations tortured and\\nenraptured by unknown fevers and\\nirresistibly forced out of\\nthemselves, amorous and longing for\\nforeign races (for such as \"let\\nthemselves be fructified\"), and withal\\nimperious, like everything\\nconscious of being full of generative force,\\nand consequently\\nempowered \"by the grace of god.\"  these two kinds of\\ngeniuses seek\\neach other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand\\neach other\\n--like man and woman.\\n\\n249. every nation has its own \"tartuffery,\" and\\ncalls that its\\nvirtue.--one does not know--cannot know, the best that\\nis in one.\\n\\n250. what europe owes to the jews?--many things, good and\\nbad, and above\\nall one thing of the nature both of the best and the\\nworst: the grand\\nstyle in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of\\ninfinite demands, of\\ninfinite significations, the whole romanticism\\nand sublimity of moral\\nquestionableness--and consequently just the\\nmost attractive, ensnaring,\\nand exquisite element in those\\niridescences and allurements to life,\\nin the aftersheen of which the\\nsky of our european culture, its evening\\nsky, now glows--perhaps glows\\nout.  for this, we artists among the\\nspectators and philosophers, are\\n--grateful to the jews.\\n\\n251. it must be taken into the bargain, if\\nvarious clouds and\\ndisturbances--in short, slight attacks of stupidity\\n--pass over the\\nspirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer\\nfrom national\\nnervous fever and political ambition: for instance,\\namong present-day\\ngermans there is alternately the anti-french folly,\\nthe anti-semitic\\nfolly, the anti-polish folly, the christian-romantic\\nfolly, the\\nwagnerian folly, the teutonic folly, the prussian folly\\n(just look at\\nthose poor historians, the sybels and treitschkes, and\\ntheir closely\\nbandaged heads), and whatever else these little\\nobscurations of the\\ngerman spirit and conscience may be called.  may\\nit be forgiven me that\\ni, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very\\ninfected ground, did not\\nremain wholly exempt from the disease, but\\nlike every one else, began\\nto entertain thoughts about matters which\\ndid not concern me--the first\\nsymptom of political infection.  about\\nthe jews, for instance, listen\\nto the following:--i have never yet met\\na german who was favourably\\ninclined to the jews; and however decided\\nthe repudiation of actual\\nanti-semitism may be on the part of all\\nprudent and political men, this\\nprudence and policy is not perhaps\\ndirected against the nature of the\\nsentiment itself, but only against\\nits dangerous excess, and especially\\nagainst the distasteful and\\ninfamous expression of this excess of\\nsentiment;--on this point we\\nmust not deceive ourselves.  that germany\\nhas amply sufficient jews,\\nthat the german stomach, the german blood,\\nhas difficulty (and will\\nlong have difficulty) in disposing only of this\\nquantity of \"jew\"--as\\nthe italian, the frenchman, and the englishman\\nhave done by means of a\\nstronger digestion:--that is the unmistakable\\ndeclaration and language\\nof a general instinct, to which one must listen\\nand according to which\\none must act.  \"let no more jews come in!  and shut\\nthe doors,\\nespecially towards the east (also towards austria)!\"--thus\\ncommands\\nthe instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and\\nuncertain,\\nso that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by\\na\\nstronger race.  the jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,\\ntoughest, and purest race at present living in europe, they know how\\nto succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under\\nfavourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would\\nlike\\nnowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith\\nwhich\\ndoes not need to be ashamed before \"modern ideas\", they alter\\nonly,\\nwhen they do alter, in the same way that the russian empire\\nmakes\\nits conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of\\nyesterday--namely, according to the principle, \"as slowly as\\npossible\"!\\na thinker who has the future of europe at heart, will, in\\nall his\\nperspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the jews,\\nas he\\nwill calculate upon the russians, as above all the surest and\\nlikeliest\\nfactors in the great play and battle of forces.  that which\\nis at present\\ncalled a \"nation\" in europe, and is really rather a res\\nfacta than nata\\n(indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta\\net picta), is in\\nevery case something evolving, young, easily\\ndisplaced, and not yet\\na race, much less such a race aere perennus, as\\nthe jews are such\\n\"nations\" should most carefully avoid all hot-headed\\nrivalry and\\nhostility!  it is certain that the jews, if they desired--\\nor if they\\nwere driven to it, as the anti-semites seem to wish--could\\nnow have the\\nascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over europe,\\nthat they are not\\nworking and planning for that end is equally\\ncertain.  meanwhile, they\\nrather wish and desire, even somewhat\\nimportunely, to be insorbed and\\nabsorbed by europe, they long to be\\nfinally settled, authorized, and\\nrespected somewhere, and wish to put\\nan end to the nomadic life, to the\\n\"wandering jew\",--and one should\\ncertainly take account of this impulse\\nand tendency, and make advances\\nto it (it possibly betokens a mitigation\\nof the jewish instincts) for\\nwhich purpose it would perhaps be useful\\nand fair to banish the anti-\\nsemitic bawlers out of the country.  one\\nshould make advances with all\\nprudence, and with selection, pretty much\\nas the english nobility do\\nit stands to reason that the more powerful\\nand strongly marked types\\nof new germanism could enter into relation\\nwith the jews with the\\nleast hesitation, for instance, the nobleman\\nofficer from the prussian\\nborder it would be interesting in many ways\\nto see whether the genius\\nfor money and patience (and especially some\\nintellect and\\nintellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred to)\\ncould not in\\naddition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of\\ncommanding\\nand obeying--for both of which the country in question has\\nnow a\\nclassic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festal\\ndiscourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached my\\nserious topic, the \"european problem,\" as i understand it, the rearing\\nof a new ruling caste for europe.\\n\\n252. they are not a philosophical\\nrace--the english: bacon represents an\\nattack on the philosophical\\nspirit generally, hobbes, hume, and locke,\\nan abasement, and a\\ndepreciation of the idea of a \"philosopher\" for more\\nthan a century.\\nit was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself;\\nit was locke\\nof whom schelling rightly said, \"je meprise locke\"; in the\\nstruggle\\nagainst the english mechanical stultification of the world,\\nhegel and\\nschopenhauer (along with goethe) were of one accord; the\\ntwo hostile\\nbrother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different\\ndirections\\ntowards the opposite poles of german thought, and thereby\\nwronged each\\nother as only brothers will do.--what is lacking in\\nengland, and has\\nalways been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician\\nknew well enough,\\nthe absurd muddle-head, carlyle, who sought to conceal\\nunder\\npassionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was\\nlacking in carlyle--real power of intellect, real depth of\\nintellectual\\nperception, in short, philosophy.  it is characteristic\\nof such an\\nunphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianity--\\nthey need its\\ndiscipline for \"moralizing\" and humanizing.  the\\nenglishman, more gloomy,\\nsensual, headstrong, and brutal than the\\ngerman--is for that very\\nreason, as the baser of the two, also the\\nmost pious: he has all the\\nmore need of christianity.  to finer\\nnostrils, this english christianity\\nitself has still a characteristic\\nenglish taint of spleen and alcoholic\\nexcess, for which, owing to good\\nreasons, it is used as an antidote--the\\nfiner poison to neutralize the\\ncoarser: a finer form of poisoning is\\nin fact a step in advance with\\ncoarse-mannered people, a step towards\\nspiritualization.  the english\\ncoarseness and rustic demureness is still\\nmost satisfactorily\\ndisguised by christian pantomime, and by praying\\nand psalm-singing\\n(or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and\\ndifferently\\nexpressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who\\nformerly\\nlearned moral grunting under the influence of methodism (and\\nmore\\nrecently as the \"salvation army\"), a penitential fit may really be\\nthe\\nrelatively highest manifestation of \"humanity\" to which they can\\nbe\\nelevated: so much may reasonably be admitted.  that, however, which\\noffends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music, to speak\\nfiguratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in\\nthe movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for\\nrhythm and dance, for \"music.\"  listen to him speaking; look at the\\nmost\\nbeautiful englishwoman walking--in no country on earth are there\\nmore\\nbeautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing!  but\\ni ask\\ntoo much...\\n\\n253. there are truths which are best recognized by\\nmediocre minds,\\nbecause they are best adapted for them, there are\\ntruths which only\\npossess charms and seductive power for mediocre\\nspirits:--one is pushed\\nto this probably unpleasant conclusion, now\\nthat the influence of\\nrespectable but mediocre englishmen--i may\\nmention darwin, john\\nstuart mill, and herbert spencer--begins to gain\\nthe ascendancy in the\\nmiddle-class region of european taste.  indeed,\\nwho could doubt that it\\nis a useful thing for such minds to have the\\nascendancy for a time?  it\\nwould be an error to consider the highly\\ndeveloped and independently\\nsoaring minds as specially qualified for\\ndetermining and collecting many\\nlittle common facts, and deducing\\nconclusions from them; as exceptions,\\nthey are rather from the first\\nin no very favourable position towards\\nthose who are \"the rules.\"\\nafter all, they have more to do than merely\\nto perceive:--in effect,\\nthey have to be something new, they have to\\nsignify something new,\\nthey have to represent new values!  the gulf\\nbetween knowledge and\\ncapacity is perhaps greater, and also more\\nmysterious, than one\\nthinks: the capable man in the grand style, the\\ncreator, will possibly\\nhave to be an ignorant person;--while on the\\nother hand, for\\nscientific discoveries like those of darwin, a certain\\nnarrowness,\\naridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something\\nenglish) may\\nnot be unfavourable for arriving at them.--finally, let\\nit not be\\nforgotten that the english, with their profound mediocrity,\\nbrought\\nabout once before a general depression of european intelligence.\\n\\nwhat\\nis called \"modern ideas,\" or \"the ideas of the eighteenth century,\"\\nor\\n\"french ideas\"--that, consequently, against which the german mind\\nrose\\nup with profound disgust--is of english origin, there is no doubt\\nabout it.  the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas,\\ntheir\\nbest soldiers, and likewise, alas!  their first and profoundest\\nvictims;\\nfor owing to the diabolical anglomania of \"modern ideas,\" the\\name\\nfrancais has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at\\npresent\\none recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its\\nprofound,\\npassionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with\\ndisbelief.\\none must, however, maintain this verdict of historical\\njustice in\\na determined manner, and defend it against present\\nprejudices and\\nappearances: the european noblesse--of sentiment,\\ntaste, and manners,\\ntaking the word in every high sense--is the work\\nand invention of\\nfrance; the european ignobleness, the plebeianism of\\nmodern ideas--is\\nengland\\'s work and invention.\\n\\n254. even at present\\nfrance is still the seat of the most intellectual\\nand refined culture\\nof europe, it is still the high school of taste; but\\none must know how\\nto find this \"france of taste.\"  he who belongs to it\\nkeeps himself\\nwell concealed:--they may be a small number in whom it\\nlives and is\\nembodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon\\nthe\\nstrongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in\\npart\\npersons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the ambition to\\nconceal themselves.\\n\\nthey have all something in common: they keep\\ntheir ears closed in\\npresence of the delirious folly and noisy\\nspouting of the democratic\\nbourgeois.  in fact, a besotted and\\nbrutalized france at present sprawls\\nin the foreground--it recently\\ncelebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste,\\nand at the same time of\\nself-admiration, at the funeral of victor hugo.\\nthere is also\\nsomething else common to them: a predilection to resist\\nintellectual\\ngermanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!\\nin this france of\\nintellect, which is also a france of pessimism,\\nschopenhauer has\\nperhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than\\nhe has ever been\\nin germany; not to speak of heinrich heine, who has\\nlong ago been re-\\nincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists\\nof paris; or of\\nhegel, who at present, in the form of taine--the first\\nof living\\nhistorians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence.  as\\nregards\\nrichard wagner, however, the more french music learns to\\nadapt itself\\nto the actual needs of the ame moderne, the more will it\\n\"wagnerite\";\\none can safely predict that beforehand,--it is already\\ntaking place\\nsufficiently!  there are, however, three things which the\\nfrench can\\nstill boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,\\nand as\\nindelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority\\nin europe,\\nin spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and\\nvulgarizing\\nof taste.  firstly, the capacity for artistic emotion, for\\ndevotion to\\n\"form,\" for which the expression, l\\'art pour l\\'art, along\\nwith\\nnumerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been\\nlacking in france for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for\\nthe \"small number,\" it has again and again made a sort of chamber\\nmusic of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere\\nin\\neurope.--the second thing whereby the french can lay claim to\\na\\nsuperiority over europe is their ancient, many-sided, moralistic\\nculture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty\\nromanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de paris, a\\npsychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one\\nhas no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in germany.\\nthe germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work\\nrequisite\\nthereto, which, as we have said, france has not grudged:\\nthose who call\\nthe germans \"naive\" on that account give them\\ncommendation for a defect.\\n(as the opposite of the german inexperience\\nand innocence in voluptate\\npsychologica, which is not too remotely\\nassociated with the tediousness\\nof german intercourse,--and as the\\nmost successful expression of\\ngenuine french curiosity and inventive\\ntalent in this domain of delicate\\nthrills, henri beyle may be noted;\\nthat remarkable anticipatory and\\nforerunning man, who, with a\\nnapoleonic tempo, traversed his europe,\\nin fact, several centuries of\\nthe european soul, as a surveyor and\\ndiscoverer thereof:--it has\\nrequired two generations to overtake him\\none way or other, to divine\\nlong afterwards some of the riddles\\nthat perplexed and enraptured him\\n--this strange epicurean and man of\\ninterrogation, the last great\\npsychologist of france).--there is yet\\na third claim to superiority:\\nin the french character there is a\\nsuccessful half-way synthesis of\\nthe north and south, which makes them\\ncomprehend many things, and\\nenjoins upon them other things, which an\\nenglishman can never\\ncomprehend.  their temperament, turned alternately\\nto and from the\\nsouth, in which from time to time the provencal and\\nligurian blood\\nfroths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern\\ngrey-in-grey,\\nfrom sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of\\nblood--our\\ngerman infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence\\nof which at\\nthe present moment, blood and iron, that is to say \"high\\npolitics,\"\\nhas with great resolution been prescribed (according to\\na dangerous\\nhealing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet\\nhope).--there is\\nalso still in france a pre-understanding and\\nready welcome for those\\nrarer and rarely gratified men, who are too\\ncomprehensive to find\\nsatisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and\\nknow how to love the\\nsouth when in the north and the north when in the\\nsouth--the born\\nmidlanders, the \"good europeans.\"  for them bizet\\nhas made music, this\\nlatest genius, who has seen a new beauty and\\nseduction,--who has\\ndiscovered a piece of the south in music.\\n\\n255. i hold that many\\nprecautions should be taken against german music.\\nsuppose a person\\nloves the south as i love it--as a great school\\nof recovery for the\\nmost spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a\\nboundless solar\\nprofusion and effulgence which o\\'erspreads a sovereign\\nexistence\\nbelieving in itself--well, such a person will learn to be\\nsomewhat on\\nhis guard against german music, because, in injuring his\\ntaste anew,\\nit will also injure his health anew.  such a southerner, a\\nsoutherner\\nnot by origin but by belief, if he should dream of the future\\nof\\nmusic, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the\\nnorth; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier,\\nand\\nperhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-german music,\\nwhich\\ndoes not fade, pale, and die away, as all german music does, at\\nthe\\nsight of the blue, wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of\\nsky--a\\nsuper-european music, which holds its own even in presence of\\nthe brown\\nsunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree,\\nand can be\\nat home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of\\nprey... i\\ncould imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be\\nthat it knew\\nnothing more of good and evil; only that here and there\\nperhaps some\\nsailor\\'s home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender\\nweaknesses might\\nsweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far\\ndistance, would see\\nthe colours of a sinking and almost\\nincomprehensible moral world fleeing\\ntowards it, and would be\\nhospitable enough and profound enough to\\nreceive such belated\\nfugitives.\\n\\n256. owing to the morbid estrangement which the\\nnationality-craze has\\ninduced and still induces among the nations of\\neurope, owing also to the\\nshort-sighted and hasty-handed politicians,\\nwho with the help of this\\ncraze, are at present in power, and do not\\nsuspect to what extent the\\ndisintegrating policy they pursue must\\nnecessarily be only an interlude\\npolicy--owing to all this and much\\nelse that is altogether unmentionable\\nat present, the most\\nunmistakable signs that europe wishes to be one,\\nare now overlooked,\\nor arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted.  with all\\nthe more profound\\nand large-minded men of this century, the real general\\ntendency of the\\nmysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way\\nfor that new\\nsynthesis, and tentatively to anticipate the european of\\nthe future;\\nonly in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in\\nold age\\nperhaps, did they belong to the \"fatherlands\"--they only rested\\nfrom\\nthemselves when they became \"patriots.\"  i think of such men as\\nnapoleon, goethe, beethoven, stendhal, heinrich heine, schopenhauer:\\nit\\nmust not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them,\\nabout\\nwhom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own\\nmisunderstandings\\n(geniuses like him have seldom the right to\\nunderstand themselves),\\nstill less, of course, by the unseemly noise\\nwith which he is now\\nresisted and opposed in france: the fact remains,\\nnevertheless, that\\nrichard wagner and the later french romanticism of\\nthe forties, are\\nmost closely and intimately related to one another.\\nthey are akin,\\nfundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of\\ntheir requirements;\\nit is europe, the one europe, whose soul presses\\nurgently and longingly,\\noutwards and upwards, in their multifarious\\nand boisterous art--whither?\\ninto a new light?  towards a new sun?\\nbut who would attempt to express\\naccurately what all these masters of\\nnew modes of speech could not\\nexpress distinctly?  it is certain that\\nthe same storm and stress\\ntormented them, that they sought in the same\\nmanner, these last great\\nseekers!  all of them steeped in literature\\nto their eyes and ears--the\\nfirst artists of universal literary\\nculture--for the most part even\\nthemselves writers, poets,\\nintermediaries and blenders of the arts and\\nthe senses (wagner, as\\nmusician is reckoned among painters, as poet\\namong musicians, as\\nartist generally among actors); all of them fanatics\\nfor expression\\n\"at any cost\"--i specially mention delacroix, the nearest\\nrelated to\\nwagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the\\nsublime,\\nalso of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers\\nin\\neffect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented\\nfar beyond their genius, out and out virtuosi, with mysterious\\naccesses\\nto all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born\\nenemies of\\nlogic and of the straight line, hankering after the\\nstrange, the\\nexotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-\\ncontradictory; as men,\\ntantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who\\nknew themselves to be\\nincapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life\\nand action--think\\nof balzac, for instance,--unrestrained workers,\\nalmost destroying\\nthemselves by work; antinomians and rebels in\\nmanners, ambitious and\\ninsatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment;\\nall of them finally\\nshattering and sinking down at the christian cross\\n(and with right\\nand reason, for who of them would have been\\nsufficiently profound and\\nsufficiently original for an anti-christian\\nphilosophy?);--on the\\nwhole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing,\\nhigh-flying, and\\naloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first\\nto teach their\\ncentury--and it is the century of the masses--the\\nconception \"higher\\nman.\"... let the german friends of richard wagner\\nadvise together as to\\nwhether there is anything purely german in the\\nwagnerian art, or whether\\nits distinction does not consist precisely\\nin coming from super-german\\nsources and impulses: in which connection\\nit may not be underrated\\nhow indispensable paris was to the\\ndevelopment of his type, which the\\nstrength of his instincts made him\\nlong to visit at the most\\ndecisive time--and how the whole style of\\nhis proceedings, of his\\nself-apostolate, could only perfect itself in\\nsight of the french\\nsocialistic original.  on a more subtle comparison\\nit will perhaps be\\nfound, to the honour of richard wagner\\'s german\\nnature, that he has\\nacted in everything with more strength, daring,\\nseverity, and elevation\\nthan a nineteenth-century frenchman could have\\ndone--owing to the\\ncircumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to\\nbarbarism than the\\nfrench;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation\\nof richard wagner is\\nnot only at present, but for ever inaccessible,\\nincomprehensible, and\\ninimitable to the whole latter-day latin race:\\nthe figure of siegfried,\\nthat very free man, who is probably far too\\nfree, too hard, too\\ncheerful, too healthy, too anti-catholic for the\\ntaste of old and mellow\\ncivilized nations.  he may even have been a\\nsin against romanticism, this\\nanti-latin siegfried: well, wagner\\natoned amply for this sin in his old\\nsad days, when--anticipating a\\ntaste which has meanwhile passed into\\npolitics--he began, with the\\nreligious vehemence peculiar to him, to\\npreach, at least, the way to\\nrome, if not to walk therein.--that\\nthese last words may not be\\nmisunderstood, i will call to my aid a few\\npowerful rhymes, which will\\neven betray to less delicate ears what i\\nmean--what i mean counter to\\nthe \"last wagner\" and his parsifal music:--\\n\\n--is this our mode?--from\\ngerman heart came this vexed ululating?  from\\ngerman body, this self-\\nlacerating?  is ours this priestly hand-dilation,\\nthis incense-fuming\\nexaltation?  is ours this faltering, falling,\\nshambling, this quite\\nuncertain ding-dong-dangling?  this sly\\nnun-ogling, ave-hour-bell\\nringing, this wholly false enraptured\\nheaven-o\\'erspringing?--is this\\nour mode?--think well!--ye still wait for\\nadmission--for what ye hear\\nis rome--rome\\'s faith by intuition!\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix.  what is noble?\\n257. every elevation of the type \"man,\" has hitherto been the work of\\nan\\naristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing\\nin\\na long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among\\nhuman\\nbeings, and requiring slavery in some form or other.  without\\nthe pathos\\nof distance, such as grows out of the incarnated difference\\nof classes,\\nout of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the\\nruling caste on\\nsubordinates and instruments, and out of their equally\\nconstant\\npractice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and\\nkeeping at a\\ndistance--that other more mysterious pathos could never\\nhave arisen, the\\nlonging for an ever new widening of distance within\\nthe soul itself,\\nthe formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more\\nextended, more\\ncomprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of\\nthe type \"man,\"\\nthe continued \"self-surmounting of man,\" to use a\\nmoral formula in\\na supermoral sense.  to be sure, one must not resign\\noneself to\\nany humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin\\nof an\\naristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary\\ncondition for\\nthe elevation of the type \"man\"): the truth is hard.\\nlet us acknowledge\\nunprejudicedly how every higher civilization\\nhitherto has originated!\\nmen with a still natural nature, barbarians\\nin every terrible sense of\\nthe word, men of prey, still in possession\\nof unbroken strength of will\\nand desire for power, threw themselves\\nupon weaker, more moral, more\\npeaceful races (perhaps trading or\\ncattle-rearing communities), or upon\\nold mellow civilizations in which\\nthe final vital force was flickering\\nout in brilliant fireworks of wit\\nand depravity.  at the commencement,\\nthe noble caste was always the\\nbarbarian caste: their superiority did\\nnot consist first of all in\\ntheir physical, but in their psychical\\npower--they were more complete\\nmen (which at every point also implies\\nthe same as \"more complete\\nbeasts\").\\n\\n258. corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens\\nto break out\\namong the instincts, and that the foundation of the\\nemotions, called\\n\"life,\" is convulsed--is something radically\\ndifferent according to\\nthe organization in which it manifests itself.\\nwhen, for instance, an\\naristocracy like that of france at the\\nbeginning of the revolution,\\nflung away its privileges with sublime\\ndisgust and sacrificed itself\\nto an excess of its moral sentiments, it\\nwas corruption:--it was really\\nonly the closing act of the corruption\\nwhich had existed for centuries,\\nby virtue of which that aristocracy\\nhad abdicated step by step its\\nlordly prerogatives and lowered itself\\nto a function of royalty (in\\nthe end even to its decoration and\\nparade-dress). the essential thing,\\nhowever, in a good and healthy\\naristocracy is that it should not regard\\nitself as a function either\\nof the kingship or the commonwealth, but\\nas the significance and\\nhighest justification thereof--that it should\\ntherefore accept with a\\ngood conscience the sacrifice of a legion\\nof individuals, who, for its\\nsake, must be suppressed and reduced to\\nimperfect men, to slaves and\\ninstruments.  its fundamental belief must\\nbe precisely that society is\\nnot allowed to exist for its own sake, but\\nonly as a foundation and\\nscaffolding, by means of which a select class\\nof beings may be able to\\nelevate themselves to their higher duties, and\\nin general to a higher\\nexistence: like those sun-seeking climbing plants\\nin java--they are\\ncalled sipo matador,--which encircle an oak so\\nlong and so often with\\ntheir arms, until at last, high above it, but\\nsupported by it, they\\ncan unfold their tops in the open light, and\\nexhibit their happiness.\\n259. to refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from\\nexploitation,\\nand put one\\'s will on a par with that of others: this\\nmay result in a\\ncertain rough sense in good conduct among individuals\\nwhen the necessary\\nconditions are given (namely, the actual similarity\\nof the individuals\\nin amount of force and degree of worth, and their\\nco-relation within one\\norganization). as soon, however, as one wished\\nto take this principle\\nmore generally, and if possible even as the\\nfundamental principle of\\nsociety, it would immediately disclose what\\nit really is--namely, a will\\nto the denial of life, a principle of\\ndissolution and decay.  here one\\nmust think profoundly to the very\\nbasis and resist all sentimental\\nweakness: life itself is essentially\\nappropriation, injury, conquest\\nof the strange and weak, suppression,\\nseverity, obtrusion of\\npeculiar forms, incorporation, and at the\\nleast, putting it mildest,\\nexploitation;--but why should one for ever\\nuse precisely these words\\non which for ages a disparaging purpose has\\nbeen stamped?  even the\\norganization within which, as was previously\\nsupposed, the\\nindividuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in\\nevery\\nhealthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a\\ndying\\norganization, do all that towards other bodies, which the\\nindividuals\\nwithin it refrain from doing to each other it will have to\\nbe the\\nincarnated will to power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain\\nground,\\nattract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any\\nmorality or\\nimmorality, but because it lives, and because life is\\nprecisely will to\\npower.  on no point, however, is the ordinary\\nconsciousness of europeans\\nmore unwilling to be corrected than on this\\nmatter, people now rave\\neverywhere, even under the guise of science,\\nabout coming conditions of\\nsociety in which \"the exploiting character\"\\nis to be absent--that sounds\\nto my ears as if they promised to invent\\na mode of life which should\\nrefrain from all organic functions.\\n\"exploitation\" does not belong to a\\ndepraved, or imperfect and\\nprimitive society it belongs to the nature of\\nthe living being as a\\nprimary organic function, it is a consequence\\nof the intrinsic will to\\npower, which is precisely the will to\\nlife--granting that as a theory\\nthis is a novelty--as a reality it is\\nthe fundamental fact of all\\nhistory let us be so far honest towards\\nourselves!\\n\\n260. in a tour\\nthrough the many finer and coarser moralities which have\\nhitherto\\nprevailed or still prevail on the earth, i found certain traits\\nrecurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until\\nfinally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical\\ndistinction was brought to light.  there is master-morality and\\nslave-\\nmorality,--i would at once add, however, that in all higher and\\nmixed\\ncivilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of\\nthe\\ntwo moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and\\nmutual\\nmisunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close\\njuxtaposition--\\neven in the same man, within one soul.  the distinctions\\nof moral\\nvalues have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly\\nconscious\\nof being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class,\\nthe\\nslaves and dependents of all sorts.  in the first case, when it is\\nthe\\nrulers who determine the conception \"good,\" it is the exalted, proud\\ndisposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that\\nwhich determines the order of rank.  the noble type of man separates\\nfrom himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud\\ndisposition displays itself he despises them.  let it at once be noted\\nthat in this first kind of morality the antithesis \"good\" and \"bad\"\\nmeans practically the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable\",--the\\nantithesis\\n\"good\" and \"evil\" is of a different origin.  the cowardly,\\nthe timid, the\\ninsignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow\\nutility are despised;\\nmoreover, also, the distrustful, with their\\nconstrained glances, the\\nself-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who\\nlet themselves be abused,\\nthe mendicant flatterers, and above all the\\nliars:--it is a fundamental\\nbelief of all aristocrats that the common\\npeople are untruthful.  \"we\\ntruthful ones\"--the nobility in ancient\\ngreece called themselves.  it is\\nobvious that everywhere the\\ndesignations of moral value were at first\\napplied to men; and were\\nonly derivatively and at a later period applied\\nto actions; it is a\\ngross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals\\nstart with\\nquestions like, \"why have sympathetic actions been praised?\"\\nthe noble\\ntype of man regards himself as a determiner of values; he\\ndoes not\\nrequire to be approved of; he passes the judgment: \"what is\\ninjurious\\nto me is injurious in itself;\" he knows that it is he himself\\nonly who\\nconfers honour on things; he is a creator of values.  he\\nhonours\\nwhatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals\\nself-\\nglorification.  in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude,\\nof power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the\\nconsciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble\\nman also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but\\nrather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power.  the\\nnoble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power\\nover himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who\\ntakes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has\\nreverence for all that is severe and hard.  \"wotan placed a hard heart\\nin\\nmy breast,\" says an old scandinavian saga: it is thus rightly\\nexpressed\\nfrom the soul of a proud viking.  such a type of man is even\\nproud of not\\nbeing made for sympathy; the hero of the saga therefore\\nadds warningly:\\n\"he who has not a hard heart when young, will never\\nhave one.\"  the noble\\nand brave who think thus are the furthest\\nremoved from the morality\\nwhich sees precisely in sympathy, or in\\nacting for the good of others,\\nor in desinteressement, the\\ncharacteristic of the moral; faith\\nin oneself, pride in oneself, a\\nradical enmity and irony towards\\n\"selflessness,\" belong as definitely\\nto noble morality, as do a careless\\nscorn and precaution in presence\\nof sympathy and the \"warm heart.\"--it\\nis the powerful who know how to\\nhonour, it is their art, their domain\\nfor invention.  the profound\\nreverence for age and for tradition--all law\\nrests on this double\\nreverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of\\nancestors and\\nunfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of\\nthe powerful;\\nand if, reversely, men of \"modern ideas\" believe almost\\ninstinctively\\nin \"progress\" and the \"future,\" and are more and more\\nlacking in\\nrespect for old age, the ignoble origin of these \"ideas\" has\\ncomplacently betrayed itself thereby.  a morality of the ruling class,\\nhowever, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day\\ntaste\\nin the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to\\none\\'s\\nequals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards\\nall\\nthat is foreign, just as seems good to one, or \"as the heart\\ndesires,\"\\nand in any case \"beyond good and evil\": it is here that\\nsympathy and\\nsimilar sentiments can have a place.  the ability and\\nobligation to\\nexercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both\\nonly within the\\ncircle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation,\\nraffinement of the idea\\nin friendship, a certain necessity to have\\nenemies (as outlets for the\\nemotions of envy, quarrelsomeness,\\narrogance--in fact, in order to be\\na good friend): all these are\\ntypical characteristics of the noble\\nmorality, which, as has been\\npointed out, is not the morality of \"modern\\nideas,\" and is therefore\\nat present difficult to realize, and also to\\nunearth and disclose.--it\\nis otherwise with the second type of morality,\\nslave-morality.\\nsupposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering,\\nthe\\nunemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should\\nmoralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?\\nprobably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation\\nof\\nman will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together\\nwith\\nhis situation.  the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues\\nof the\\npowerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a refinement of\\ndistrust of\\neverything \"good\" that is there honoured--he would fain\\npersuade himself\\nthat the very happiness there is not genuine.  on the\\nother hand, those\\nqualities which serve to alleviate the existence of\\nsufferers are\\nbrought into prominence and flooded with light; it is\\nhere that\\nsympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience,\\ndiligence,\\nhumility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these\\nare the most\\nuseful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting\\nthe burden of\\nexistence.  slave-morality is essentially the morality\\nof utility.\\nhere is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis\\n\"good\" and\\n\"evil\":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in\\nthe evil,\\na certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not\\nadmit of\\nbeing despised.  according to slave-morality, therefore, the\\n\"evil\" man\\narouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely\\nthe \"good\"\\nman who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad\\nman is\\nregarded as the despicable being.  the contrast attains its\\nmaximum when,\\nin accordance with the logical consequences of slave-\\nmorality, a shade\\nof depreciation--it may be slight and well-\\nintentioned--at last attaches\\nitself to the \"good\" man of this\\nmorality; because, according to the\\nservile mode of thought, the good\\nman must in any case be the safe\\nman: he is good-natured, easily\\ndeceived, perhaps a little stupid, un\\nbonhomme.  everywhere that\\nslave-morality gains the ascendancy, language\\nshows a tendency to\\napproximate the significations of the words \"good\"\\nand \"stupid.\"--a\\nlast fundamental difference: the desire for freedom,\\nthe instinct for\\nhappiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty\\nbelong as\\nnecessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and\\nenthusiasm\\nin reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an\\naristocratic\\nmode of thinking and estimating.--hence we can understand\\nwithout\\nfurther detail why love as a passion--it is our european\\nspecialty--\\nmust absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its\\ninvention is\\ndue to the provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant,\\ningenious men of\\nthe \"gai saber,\" to whom europe owes so much, and\\nalmost owes itself.\\n261. vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for\\na noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where\\nanother\\nkind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently.  the problem for\\nhim is\\nto represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good\\nopinion of\\nthemselves which they themselves do not possess--and\\nconsequently also\\ndo not \"deserve,\"--and who yet believe in this good\\nopinion\\nafterwards.  this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste\\nand so\\nself-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely\\nunreasonable,\\nthat he would like to consider vanity an exception, and\\nis doubtful\\nabout it in most cases when it is spoken of.  he will say,\\nfor\\ninstance: \"i may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand\\nmay nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others\\nprecisely as i rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-\\nconceit,\\nor, in most cases, that which is called \\'humility,\\' and also\\n\\'modesty\\').\" or he will even say: \"for many reasons i can delight in\\nthe good opinion of others, perhaps because i love and honour them,\\nand rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion\\nendorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps\\nbecause the good opinion of others, even in cases where i do not share\\nit, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this,\\nhowever,\\nis not vanity.\"  the man of noble character must first bring\\nit home\\nforcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history,\\nthat, from\\ntime immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent,\\nthe ordinary\\nman was only that which he passed for:--not being at all\\naccustomed to\\nfix values, he did not assign even to himself any other\\nvalue than that\\nwhich his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar\\nright of masters to\\ncreate values). it may be looked upon as the\\nresult of an extraordinary\\natavism, that the ordinary man, even at\\npresent, is still always waiting\\nfor an opinion about himself, and\\nthen instinctively submitting himself\\nto it; yet by no means only to a\\n\"good\" opinion, but also to a bad\\nand unjust one (think, for instance,\\nof the greater part of the\\nself-appreciations and self-depreciations\\nwhich believing women learn\\nfrom their confessors, and which in\\ngeneral the believing christian\\nlearns from his church). in fact,\\nconformably to the slow rise of the\\ndemocratic social order (and its\\ncause, the blending of the blood\\nof masters and slaves), the\\noriginally noble and rare impulse of\\nthe masters to assign a value to\\nthemselves and to \"think well\" of\\nthemselves, will now be more and\\nmore encouraged and extended; but\\nit has at all times an older,\\nampler, and more radically ingrained\\npropensity opposed to it--and in\\nthe phenomenon of \"vanity\" this older\\npropensity overmasters the\\nyounger.  the vain person rejoices over every\\ngood opinion which he\\nhears about himself (quite apart from the point\\nof view of its\\nusefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or\\nfalsehood), just as\\nhe suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects\\nhimself to both, he\\nfeels himself subjected to both, by that oldest\\ninstinct of subjection\\nwhich breaks forth in him.--it is \"the slave\"\\nin the vain man\\'s blood,\\nthe remains of the slave\\'s craftiness--and how\\nmuch of the \"slave\" is\\nstill left in woman, for instance!--which\\nseeks to seduce to good\\nopinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who\\nimmediately afterwards\\nfalls prostrate himself before these opinions, as\\nthough he had not\\ncalled them forth.--and to repeat it again: vanity is\\nan atavism.\\n262. a species originates, and a type becomes established and strong\\nin\\nthe long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable\\nconditions.  on\\nthe other hand, it is known by the experience of\\nbreeders that species\\nwhich receive super-abundant nourishment, and in\\ngeneral a surplus of\\nprotection and care, immediately tend in the most\\nmarked way to develop\\nvariations, and are fertile in prodigies and\\nmonstrosities (also in\\nmonstrous vices). now look at an aristocratic\\ncommonwealth, say\\nan ancient greek polis, or venice, as a voluntary or\\ninvoluntary\\ncontrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings; there\\nare there men\\nbeside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who\\nwant to make\\ntheir species prevail, chiefly because they must prevail,\\nor else\\nrun the terrible danger of being exterminated.  the favour,\\nthe\\nsuper-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which\\nvariations\\nare fostered; the species needs itself as species, as\\nsomething which,\\nprecisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity,\\nand simplicity of\\nstructure, can in general prevail and make itself\\npermanent in\\nconstant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious\\nor\\nrebellion-threatening vassals.  the most varied experience teaches\\nit\\nwhat are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that\\nit still exists, in spite of all gods and men, and has hitherto been\\nvictorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone\\nit develops to maturity.  it does so with severity, indeed it desires\\nseverity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education\\nof youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the\\nrelations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only\\nfor the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues,\\nunder the name of \"justice.\"  a type with few, but very marked\\nfeatures,\\na species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and\\nreticent\\nmen (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the\\ncharm and\\nnuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the\\nvicissitudes\\nof generations; the constant struggle with uniform\\nunfavourable\\nconditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type\\nbecoming\\nstable and hard.  finally, however, a happy state of things\\nresults, the\\nenormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more\\nenemies among the\\nneighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of\\nthe enjoyment\\nof life, are present in superabundance.  with one stroke\\nthe bond and\\nconstraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer\\nregarded as\\nnecessary, as a condition of existence--if it would\\ncontinue, it can\\nonly do so as a form of luxury, as an archaizing\\ntaste.  variations,\\nwhether they be deviations (into the higher,\\nfiner, and rarer), or\\ndeteriorations and monstrosities, appear\\nsuddenly on the scene in the\\ngreatest exuberance and splendour; the\\nindividual dares to be individual\\nand detach himself.  at this\\nturning-point of history there manifest\\nthemselves, side by side, and\\noften mixed and entangled together, a\\nmagnificent, manifold, virgin-\\nforest-like up-growth and up-striving, a\\nkind of tropical tempo in the\\nrivalry of growth, and an extraordinary\\ndecay and self-destruction,\\nowing to the savagely opposing and seemingly\\nexploding egoisms, which\\nstrive with one another \"for sun and light,\"\\nand can no longer assign\\nany limit, restraint, or forbearance for\\nthemselves by means of the\\nhitherto existing morality.  it was this\\nmorality itself which piled\\nup the strength so enormously, which bent\\nthe bow in so threatening a\\nmanner:--it is now \"out of date,\" it is\\ngetting \"out of date.\"  the\\ndangerous and disquieting point has been\\nreached when the greater,\\nmore manifold, more comprehensive life is\\nlived beyond the old\\nmorality; the \"individual\" stands out, and is\\nobliged to have recourse\\nto his own law-giving, his own arts and\\nartifices for self-\\npreservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance.\\nnothing but new\\n\"whys,\" nothing but new \"hows,\" no common formulas any\\nlonger,\\nmisunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay,\\ndeterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the\\ngenius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and\\nbad,\\na portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn, full of new\\ncharms\\nand mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still\\nunwearied\\ncorruption.  danger is again present, the mother of\\nmorality, great\\ndanger; this time shifted into the individual, into\\nthe neighbour and\\nfriend, into the street, into their own child, into\\ntheir own heart,\\ninto all the most personal and secret recesses of\\ntheir desires and\\nvolitions.  what will the moral philosophers who\\nappear at this time have\\nto preach?  they discover, these sharp\\nonlookers and loafers, that the\\nend is quickly approaching, that\\neverything around them decays and\\nproduces decay, that nothing will\\nendure until the day after tomorrow,\\nexcept one species of man, the\\nincurably mediocre.  the mediocre alone\\nhave a prospect of continuing\\nand propagating themselves--they will\\nbe the men of the future, the\\nsole survivors; \"be like them!  become\\nmediocre!\"  is now the only\\nmorality which has still a significance,\\nwhich still obtains a\\nhearing.--but it is difficult to preach this\\nmorality of mediocrity!\\nit can never avow what it is and what it\\ndesires!  it has to talk of\\nmoderation and dignity and duty and brotherly\\nlove--it will have\\ndifficulty in concealing its irony!\\n\\n263. there is an instinct for\\nrank, which more than anything else is\\nalready the sign of a high\\nrank; there is a delight in the nuances\\nof reverence which leads one\\nto infer noble origin and habits.  the\\nrefinement, goodness, and\\nloftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test\\nwhen something passes\\nby that is of the highest rank, but is not\\nyet protected by the awe of\\nauthority from obtrusive touches and\\nincivilities: something that goes\\nits way like a living touchstone,\\nundistinguished, undiscovered, and\\ntentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled\\nand disguised.  he whose task\\nand practice it is to investigate souls,\\nwill avail himself of many\\nvarieties of this very art to determine the\\nultimate value of a soul,\\nthe unalterable, innate order of rank to which\\nit belongs: he will\\ntest it by its instinct for reverence.  difference\\nengendre haine: the\\nvulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like\\ndirty water, when\\nany holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any\\nbook bearing the\\nmarks of great destiny, is brought before it; while\\non the other hand,\\nthere is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the\\neye, a cessation\\nof all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul\\nfeels the\\nnearness of what is worthiest of respect.  the way in which, on\\nthe\\nwhole, the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintained\\nin\\neurope, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of\\nmanners which europe owes to christianity: books of such profoundness\\nand supreme significance require for their protection an external\\ntyranny of authority, in order to acquire the period of thousands of\\nyears which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them.  much has been\\nachieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses\\n(the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not\\nallowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before\\nwhich they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--\\nit\\nis almost their highest advance towards humanity.  on the contrary,\\nin\\nthe so-called cultured classes, the believers in \"modern ideas,\"\\nnothing\\nis perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy\\ninsolence of\\neye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger\\neverything; and it\\nis possible that even yet there is more relative\\nnobility of taste, and\\nmore tact for reverence among the people, among\\nthe lower classes of\\nthe people, especially among peasants, than among\\nthe newspaper-reading\\ndemimonde of intellect, the cultured class.\\n264. it cannot be effaced from a man\\'s soul what his ancestors have\\npreferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps\\ndiligent\\neconomizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and\\ncitizen-like\\nin their desires, modest also in their virtues; or\\nwhether they were\\naccustomed to commanding from morning till night,\\nfond of rude pleasures\\nand probably of still ruder duties and\\nresponsibilities; or whether,\\nfinally, at one time or another, they\\nhave sacrificed old privileges of\\nbirth and possession, in order to\\nlive wholly for their faith--for their\\n\"god,\"--as men of an inexorable\\nand sensitive conscience, which blushes\\nat every compromise.  it is\\nquite impossible for a man not to have\\nthe qualities and predilections\\nof his parents and ancestors in his\\nconstitution, whatever appearances\\nmay suggest to the contrary.  this is\\nthe problem of race.  granted\\nthat one knows something of the parents,\\nit is admissible to draw a\\nconclusion about the child: any kind\\nof offensive incontinence, any\\nkind of sordid envy, or of clumsy\\nself-vaunting--the three things\\nwhich together have constituted the\\ngenuine plebeian type in all times\\n--such must pass over to the child, as\\nsurely as bad blood; and with\\nthe help of the best education and culture\\none will only succeed in\\ndeceiving with regard to such heredity.--and\\nwhat else does education\\nand culture try to do nowadays!  in our very\\ndemocratic, or rather,\\nvery plebeian age, \"education\" and \"culture\" must\\nbe essentially the\\nart of deceiving--deceiving with regard to origin,\\nwith regard to the\\ninherited plebeianism in body and soul.  an educator\\nwho nowadays\\npreached truthfulness above everything else, and called out\\nconstantly\\nto his pupils: \"be true!  be natural!  show yourselves as you\\nare!\"--\\neven such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time\\nto\\nhave recourse to the furca of horace, naturam expellere: with what\\nresults?  \"plebeianism\" usque recurret.  [footnote: horace\\'s\\n\"epistles,\"\\ni.  x.  24.]\\n\\n265. at the risk of displeasing innocent\\nears, i submit that egoism\\nbelongs to the essence of a noble soul, i\\nmean the unalterable belief\\nthat to a being such as \"we,\" other beings\\nmust naturally be in\\nsubjection, and have to sacrifice themselves.\\nthe noble soul accepts the\\nfact of his egoism without question, and\\nalso without consciousness of\\nharshness, constraint, or arbitrariness\\ntherein, but rather as something\\nthat may have its basis in the\\nprimary law of things:--if he sought a\\ndesignation for it he would\\nsay: \"it is justice itself.\"  he acknowledges\\nunder certain\\ncircumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that\\nthere are other\\nequally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this\\nquestion of\\nrank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged\\nones with the\\nsame assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect,\\nwhich he\\nenjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an\\ninnate\\nheavenly mechanism which all the stars understand.  it is an\\nadditional instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation\\nin intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; he\\nhonours himself in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them,\\nhe\\nhas no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the\\nessence of\\nall intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of\\nthings.  the\\nnoble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate\\nand sensitive\\ninstinct of requital, which is at the root of his\\nnature.  the notion of\\n\"favour\" has, inter pares, neither significance\\nnor good repute; there\\nmay be a sublime way of letting gifts as it\\nwere light upon one from\\nabove, and of drinking them thirstily like\\ndew-drops; but for those\\narts and displays the noble soul has no\\naptitude.  his egoism hinders him\\nhere: in general, he looks \"aloft\"\\nunwillingly--he looks either forward,\\nhorizontally and deliberately,\\nor downwards--he knows that he is on a\\nheight.\\n\\n266. \"one can only\\ntruly esteem him who does not look out for\\nhimself.\"--goethe to rath\\nschlosser.\\n\\n267. the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach\\ntheir children:\\n\"siao-sin\" (\"make thy heart small\"). this is the\\nessentially fundamental\\ntendency in latter-day civilizations.  i have\\nno doubt that an ancient\\ngreek, also, would first of all remark the\\nself-dwarfing in us europeans\\nof today--in this respect alone we\\nshould immediately be \"distasteful\"\\nto him.\\n\\n268. what, after all, is\\nignobleness?--words are vocal symbols for\\nideas; ideas, however, are\\nmore or less definite mental symbols\\nfor frequently returning and\\nconcurring sensations, for groups of\\nsensations.  it is not sufficient\\nto use the same words in order to\\nunderstand one another: we must also\\nemploy the same words for the same\\nkind of internal experiences, we\\nmust in the end have experiences in\\ncommon.  on this account the\\npeople of one nation understand one another\\nbetter than those\\nbelonging to different nations, even when they use\\nthe same language;\\nor rather, when people have lived long together under\\nsimilar\\nconditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there\\noriginates therefrom an entity that \"understands itself\"--namely, a\\nnation.  in all souls a like number of frequently recurring\\nexperiences\\nhave gained the upper hand over those occurring more\\nrarely: about\\nthese matters people understand one another rapidly and\\nalways more\\nrapidly--the history of language is the history of a\\nprocess of\\nabbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension\\npeople always\\nunite closer and closer.  the greater the danger, the\\ngreater is the\\nneed of agreeing quickly and readily about what is\\nnecessary; not to\\nmisunderstand one another in danger--that is what\\ncannot at all be\\ndispensed with in intercourse.  also in all loves and\\nfriendships one has\\nthe experience that nothing of the kind continues\\nwhen the discovery\\nhas been made that in using the same words, one of\\nthe two parties has\\nfeelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears\\ndifferent from those of\\nthe other.  (the fear of the \"eternal\\nmisunderstanding\": that is the good\\ngenius which so often keeps\\npersons of different sexes from too\\nhasty attachments, to which sense\\nand heart prompt them--and not some\\nschopenhauerian \"genius of the\\nspecies\"!) whichever groups of sensations\\nwithin a soul awaken most\\nreadily, begin to speak, and give the word of\\ncommand--these decide as\\nto the general order of rank of its values, and\\ndetermine ultimately\\nits list of desirable things.  a man\\'s estimates of\\nvalue betray\\nsomething of the structure of his soul, and wherein it\\nsees its\\nconditions of life, its intrinsic needs.  supposing now that\\nnecessity\\nhas from all time drawn together only such men as could\\nexpress\\nsimilar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols,\\nit\\nresults on the whole that the easy communicability of need,\\nwhich\\nimplies ultimately the undergoing only of average and common\\nexperiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which\\nhave hitherto operated upon mankind.  the more similar, the more\\nordinary\\npeople, have always had and are still having the advantage;\\nthe more\\nselect, more refined, more unique, and difficultly\\ncomprehensible, are\\nliable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents\\nin their isolation, and\\nseldom propagate themselves.  one must appeal\\nto immense opposing forces,\\nin order to thwart this natural, all-too-\\nnatural progressus in simile,\\nthe evolution of man to the similar, the\\nordinary, the average, the\\ngregarious--to the ignoble--!\\n\\n269. the\\nmore a psychologist--a born, an unavoidable psychologist\\nand soul-\\ndiviner--turns his attention to the more select cases and\\nindividuals,\\nthe greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:\\nhe needs\\nsternness and cheerfulness more than any other man.  for\\nthe\\ncorruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually\\nconstituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a\\nrule always before one\\'s eyes.  the manifold torment of the\\npsychologist\\nwho has discovered this ruination, who discovers once,\\nand then\\ndiscovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this\\nuniversal\\ninner \"desperateness\" of higher men, this eternal \"too\\nlate!\"  in every\\nsense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his\\nturning with\\nbitterness against his own lot, and of his making an\\nattempt at\\nself-destruction--of his \"going to ruin\" himself.  one may\\nperceive\\nin almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for\\ndelightful\\nintercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact\\nis thereby\\ndisclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a\\nsort\\nof flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and\\nincisiveness--from what his \"business\"--has laid upon his conscience.\\nthe fear of his memory is peculiar to him.  he is easily silenced by\\nthe\\njudgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people\\nhonour,\\nadmire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived--or he even\\nconceals\\nhis silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion.\\nperhaps\\nthe paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that,\\nprecisely\\nwhere he has learnt great sympathy, together with great\\ncontempt, the\\nmultitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on\\ntheir part learnt\\ngreat reverence--reverence for \"great men\" and\\nmarvelous animals, for\\nthe sake of whom one blesses and honours the\\nfatherland, the earth, the\\ndignity of mankind, and one\\'s own self, to\\nwhom one points the young,\\nand in view of whom one educates them.  and\\nwho knows but in all great\\ninstances hitherto just the same happened:\\nthat the multitude worshipped\\na god, and that the \"god\" was only a\\npoor sacrificial animal!  success\\nhas always been the greatest liar--\\nand the \"work\" itself is a success;\\nthe great statesman, the\\nconqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in\\ntheir creations until they\\nare unrecognizable; the \"work\" of the artist,\\nof the philosopher, only\\ninvents him who has created it, is reputed\\nto have created it; the\\n\"great men,\" as they are reverenced, are poor\\nlittle fictions composed\\nafterwards; in the world of historical values\\nspurious coinage\\nprevails.  those great poets, for example, such as\\nbyron, musset, poe,\\nleopardi, kleist, gogol (i do not venture to mention\\nmuch greater\\nnames, but i have them in my mind), as they now appear, and\\nwere\\nperhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous,\\nand\\nchildish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;\\nwith\\nsouls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking\\nrevenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking\\nforgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in\\nthe mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the\\nwill-o\\'-the-wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars--the\\npeople\\nthen call them idealists,--often struggling with protracted\\ndisgust,\\nwith an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes\\nthem cold,\\nand obliges them to languish for gloria and devour \"faith\\nas it is\"\\nout of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a torment\\nthese great\\nartists are and the so-called higher men in general, to\\nhim who has once\\nfound them out!  it is thus conceivable that it is\\njust from woman--who\\nis clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and\\nalso unfortunately eager\\nto help and save to an extent far beyond her\\npowers--that they have\\nlearnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless\\ndevoted sympathy, which\\nthe multitude, above all the reverent\\nmultitude, do not understand,\\nand overwhelm with prying and self-\\ngratifying interpretations.  this\\nsympathizing invariably deceives\\nitself as to its power; woman would\\nlike to believe that love can do\\neverything--it is the superstition\\npeculiar to her.  alas, he who\\nknows the heart finds out how poor,\\nhelpless, pretentious, and\\nblundering even the best and deepest love\\nis--he finds that it rather\\ndestroys than saves!--it is possible that\\nunder the holy fable and\\ntravesty of the life of jesus there is hidden\\none of the most painful\\ncases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love:\\nthe martyrdom of the\\nmost innocent and most craving heart, that\\nnever had enough of any\\nhuman love, that demanded love, that demanded\\ninexorably and\\nfrantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible\\noutbursts\\nagainst those who refused him their love; the story of a poor\\nsoul\\ninsatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send\\nthither those who would not love him--and that at last, enlightened\\nabout human love, had to invent a god who is entire love, entire\\ncapacity for love--who takes pity on human love, because it is so\\npaltry, so ignorant!  he who has such sentiments, he who has such\\nknowledge about love--seeks for death!--but why should one deal with\\nsuch painful matters?  provided, of course, that one is not obliged to\\ndo\\nso.\\n\\n270. the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man\\nwho has\\nsuffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank how\\ndeeply men\\ncan suffer--the chilling certainty, with which he is\\nthoroughly imbued\\nand coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he\\nknows more than the\\nshrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has\\nbeen familiar with,\\nand \"at home\" in, many distant, dreadful worlds of\\nwhich \"you know\\nnothing\"!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the\\nsufferer, this\\npride of the elect of knowledge, of the \"initiated,\" of\\nthe almost\\nsacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to\\nprotect itself from\\ncontact with officious and sympathizing hands, and\\nin general from all\\nthat is not its equal in suffering.  profound\\nsuffering makes noble:\\nit separates.--one of the most refined forms of\\ndisguise is epicurism,\\nalong with a certain ostentatious boldness of\\ntaste, which takes\\nsuffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive\\nagainst all that\\nis sorrowful and profound.  they are \"gay men\" who\\nmake use of gaiety,\\nbecause they are misunderstood on account of it--\\nthey wish to be\\nmisunderstood.  there are \"scientific minds\" who make\\nuse of science,\\nbecause it gives a gay appearance, and because\\nscientificness leads to\\nthe conclusion that a person is superficial--\\nthey wish to mislead to a\\nfalse conclusion.  there are free insolent\\nminds which would fain conceal\\nand deny that they are broken, proud,\\nincurable hearts (the cynicism of\\nhamlet--the case of galiani); and\\noccasionally folly itself is the mask\\nof an unfortunate over-assured\\nknowledge.--from which it follows that it\\nis the part of a more\\nrefined humanity to have reverence \"for the mask,\"\\nand not to make use\\nof psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.\\n\\n271. that which\\nseparates two men most profoundly is a different sense\\nand grade of\\npurity.  what does it matter about all their honesty and\\nreciprocal\\nusefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual\\ngood-will: the\\nfact still remains--they \"cannot smell each other!\"  the\\nhighest\\ninstinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the\\nmost\\nextraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just\\nholiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question.\\nany\\nkind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the\\nbath,\\nany kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul\\nout\\nof night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of \"affliction\"\\ninto\\nclearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:--just as much as\\nsuch a\\ntendency distinguishes--it is a noble tendency--it also\\nseparates.--the\\npity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human,\\nall-too-human.\\nand there are grades and heights where pity itself is\\nregarded by him as\\nimpurity, as filth.\\n\\n272. signs of nobility: never\\nto think of lowering our duties to the\\nrank of duties for everybody;\\nto be unwilling to renounce or to share\\nour responsibilities; to count\\nour prerogatives, and the exercise of\\nthem, among our duties.\\n\\n273. a\\nman who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom\\nhe\\nencounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and\\nhindrance--or as a temporary resting-place.  his peculiar lofty bounty\\nto his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and\\ndominates.  impatience, and the consciousness of being always\\ncondemned\\nto comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy, and\\nconceals the\\nend, as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him;\\nthis kind of\\nman is acquainted with solitude, and what is most\\npoisonous in it.\\n\\n274. the problem of those who wait.--happy chances\\nare necessary, and\\nmany incalculable elements, in order that a higher\\nman in whom the\\nsolution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action,\\nor \"break forth,\"\\nas one might say--at the right moment.  on an\\naverage it does not happen;\\nand in all corners of the earth there are\\nwaiting ones sitting who\\nhardly know to what extent they are waiting,\\nand still less that they\\nwait in vain.  occasionally, too, the waking\\ncall comes too late--the\\nchance which gives \"permission\" to take\\naction--when their best youth,\\nand strength for action have been used\\nup in sitting still; and how many\\na one, just as he \"sprang up,\" has\\nfound with horror that his limbs are\\nbenumbed and his spirits are now\\ntoo heavy!  \"it is too late,\" he has\\nsaid to himself--and has become\\nself-distrustful and henceforth for ever\\nuseless.--in the domain of\\ngenius, may not the \"raphael without\\nhands\" (taking the expression in\\nits widest sense) perhaps not be the\\nexception, but the rule?--perhaps\\ngenius is by no means so rare: but\\nrather the five hundred hands which\\nit requires in order to tyrannize\\nover the [greek inserted here], \"the\\nright time\"--in order to take\\nchance by the forelock!\\n\\n275. he who\\ndoes not wish to see the height of a man, looks all the\\nmore sharply\\nat what is low in him, and in the foreground--and thereby\\nbetrays\\nhimself.\\n\\n276. in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser\\nsoul is\\nbetter off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter\\nmust be\\ngreater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish\\nis in\\nfact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of\\nits\\nexistence.--in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost;\\nnot so\\nin man.--\\n\\n277. it is too bad!  always the old story!  when a\\nman has finished\\nbuilding his house, he finds that he has learnt\\nunawares something\\nwhich he ought absolutely to have known before he--\\nbegan to build.  the\\neternal, fatal \"too late!\"  the melancholia of\\neverything completed--!\\n\\n278.--wanderer, who art thou?  i see thee\\nfollow thy path without scorn,\\nwithout love, with unfathomable eyes,\\nwet and sad as a plummet which has\\nreturned to the light insatiated\\nout of every depth--what did it seek\\ndown there?--with a bosom that\\nnever sighs, with lips that conceal their\\nloathing, with a hand which\\nonly slowly grasps: who art thou?  what\\nhast thou done?  rest thee\\nhere: this place has hospitality for every\\none--refresh thyself!  and\\nwhoever thou art, what is it that now pleases\\nthee?  what will serve\\nto refresh thee?  only name it, whatever i have\\ni offer thee!  \"to\\nrefresh me?  to refresh me?  oh, thou prying one,\\nwhat sayest thou!\\nbut give me, i pray thee---\" what?  what?  speak out!\\n\"another mask!\\na second mask!\"\\n\\n279. men of profound sadness betray themselves when\\nthey are happy: they\\nhave a mode of seizing upon happiness as though\\nthey would choke and\\nstrangle it, out of jealousy--ah, they know only\\ntoo well that it will\\nflee from them!\\n\\n280. \"bad!  bad!  what?  does\\nhe not--go back?\"  yes!  but you misunderstand\\nhim when you complain\\nabout it.  he goes back like every one who is about\\nto make a great\\nspring.\\n\\n281.--\"will people believe it of me?  but i insist that they\\nbelieve it\\nof me: i have always thought very unsatisfactorily of\\nmyself and about\\nmyself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily,\\nalways without\\ndelight in \\'the subject,\\' ready to digress from\\n\\'myself,\\' and always\\nwithout faith in the result, owing to an\\nunconquerable distrust of the\\npossibility of self-knowledge, which has\\nled me so far as to feel a\\ncontradictio in adjecto even in the idea of\\n\\'direct knowledge\\' which\\ntheorists allow themselves:--this matter of\\nfact is almost the most\\ncertain thing i know about myself.  there must\\nbe a sort of repugnance\\nin me to believe anything definite about\\nmyself.--is there perhaps\\nsome enigma therein?  probably; but\\nfortunately nothing for my own\\nteeth.--perhaps it betrays the species\\nto which i belong?--but not to\\nmyself, as is sufficiently agreeable to\\nme.\"\\n\\n282.--\"but what has happened to you?\"--\"i do not know,\" he said,\\nhesitatingly; \"perhaps the harpies have flown over my table.\"--it\\nsometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes\\nsuddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves,\\nand\\nshocks everybody--and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at\\nhimself--whither?  for what purpose?  to famish apart?  to suffocate\\nwith\\nhis memories?--to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty\\nsoul,\\nand only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the\\ndanger\\nwill always be great--nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily\\nso.\\nthrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he\\ndoes\\nnot like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of\\nhunger\\nand thirst--or, should he nevertheless finally \"fall to,\" of\\nsudden\\nnausea.--we have probably all sat at tables to which we did not\\nbelong;\\nand precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult\\nto\\nnourish, know the dangerous dyspepsia which originates from a\\nsudden\\ninsight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates--\\nthe\\nafter-dinner nausea.\\n\\n283. if one wishes to praise at all, it is a\\ndelicate and at the\\nsame time a noble self-control, to praise only\\nwhere one does not\\nagree--otherwise in fact one would praise oneself,\\nwhich is contrary\\nto good taste:--a self-control, to be sure, which\\noffers excellent\\nopportunity and provocation to constant\\nmisunderstanding.  to be able to\\nallow oneself this veritable luxury\\nof taste and morality, one must\\nnot live among intellectual imbeciles,\\nbut rather among men whose\\nmisunderstandings and mistakes amuse by\\ntheir refinement--or one will\\nhave to pay dearly for it!--\"he praises\\nme, therefore he acknowledges me\\nto be right\"--this asinine method of\\ninference spoils half of the life\\nof us recluses, for it brings the\\nasses into our neighbourhood and\\nfriendship.\\n\\n284. to live in a vast\\nand proud tranquility; always beyond... to have,\\nor not to have, one\\'s\\nemotions, one\\'s for and against, according to\\nchoice; to lower oneself\\nto them for hours; to seat oneself on them as\\nupon horses, and often\\nas upon asses:--for one must know how to make\\nuse of their stupidity\\nas well as of their fire.  to conserve one\\'s\\nthree hundred\\nforegrounds; also one\\'s black spectacles: for there are\\ncircumstances\\nwhen nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our\\n\"motives.\"\\nand to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice,\\npoliteness.\\nand to remain master of one\\'s four virtues, courage,\\ninsight,\\nsympathy, and solitude.  for solitude is a virtue with us, as\\na\\nsublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of\\nman and man--\"in society\"--it must be unavoidably impure.  all society\\nmakes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime--\"commonplace.\"\\n\\n285. the\\ngreatest events and thoughts--the greatest thoughts, however,\\nare the\\ngreatest events--are longest in being comprehended: the\\ngenerations\\nwhich are contemporary with them do not experience such\\nevents--they\\nlive past them.  something happens there as in the realm of\\nstars.\\nthe light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and\\nbefore\\nit has arrived man denies--that there are stars there.  \"how\\nmany\\ncenturies does a mind require to be understood?\"--that is also a\\nstandard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette\\ntherewith,\\nsuch as is necessary for mind and for star.\\n\\n286. \"here is\\nthe prospect free, the mind exalted.\"  [footnote: goethe\\'s\\n\"faust,\"\\npart ii, act v.  the words of dr.  marianus.]--but there is a\\nreverse\\nkind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free\\nprospect--\\nbut looks downwards.\\n\\n287. what is noble?  what does the word \"noble\"\\nstill mean for us\\nnowadays?  how does the noble man betray himself,\\nhow is he recognized\\nunder this heavy overcast sky of the commencing\\nplebeianism, by which\\neverything is rendered opaque and leaden?--it is\\nnot his actions which\\nestablish his claim--actions are always\\nambiguous, always inscrutable;\\nneither is it his \"works.\"  one finds\\nnowadays among artists and scholars\\nplenty of those who betray by\\ntheir works that a profound longing for\\nnobleness impels them; but\\nthis very need of nobleness is radically\\ndifferent from the needs of\\nthe noble soul itself, and is in fact the\\neloquent and dangerous sign\\nof the lack thereof.  it is not the works,\\nbut the belief which is\\nhere decisive and determines the order of\\nrank--to employ once more an\\nold religious formula with a new and deeper\\nmeaning--it is some\\nfundamental certainty which a noble soul has about\\nitself, something\\nwhich is not to be sought, is not to be found, and\\nperhaps, also, is\\nnot to be lost.--the noble soul has reverence for\\nitself.--\\n\\n288.\\nthere are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn\\nand\\ntwist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their\\ntreacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always\\ncomes out at last that they have something which they hide--namely,\\nintellect.  one of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long\\nas\\npossible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider\\nthan one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as\\nan\\numbrella,--is called enthusiasm, including what belongs to it, for\\ninstance, virtue.  for as galiani said, who was obliged to know it:\\nvertu\\nest enthousiasme.\\n\\n289. in the writings of a recluse one always\\nhears something of the echo\\nof the wilderness, something of the\\nmurmuring tones and timid vigilance\\nof solitude; in his strongest\\nwords, even in his cry itself, there\\nsounds a new and more dangerous\\nkind of silence, of concealment.  he who\\nhas sat day and night, from\\nyear\\'s end to year\\'s end, alone with his\\nsoul in familiar discord and\\ndiscourse, he who has become a cave-bear,\\nor a treasure-seeker, or a\\ntreasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it\\nmay be a labyrinth, but\\ncan also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves\\neventually acquire a\\ntwilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much\\nof the depth as of\\nthe mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive,\\nwhich blows chilly\\nupon every passer-by.  the recluse does not believe\\nthat a philosopher\\n--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first\\nplace been a\\nrecluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in\\nbooks: are\\nnot books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed,\\nhe will\\ndoubt whether a philosopher can have \"ultimate and actual\"\\nopinions at\\nall; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must\\nnecessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer\\nworld\\nbeyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every\\n\"foundation.\"  every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a\\nrecluse\\'s verdict: \"there is something arbitrary in the fact that the\\nphilosopher came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked\\naround;\\nthat he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--\\nthere\\nis also something suspicious in it.\"  every philosophy also\\nconceals a\\nphilosophy; every opinion is also a lurking-place, every\\nword is also a\\nmask.\\n\\n290. every deep thinker is more afraid of being\\nunderstood than of being\\nmisunderstood.  the latter perhaps wounds his\\nvanity; but the former\\nwounds his heart, his sympathy, which always\\nsays: \"ah, why would you\\nalso have as hard a time of it as i have?\"\\n291. man, a complex, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal,\\nuncanny\\nto the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than\\nby his\\nstrength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to\\nenjoy his\\nsoul as something simple; and the whole of morality is a\\nlong, audacious\\nfalsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment\\nat the sight of\\nthe soul becomes possible.  from this point of view\\nthere is perhaps much\\nmore in the conception of \"art\" than is\\ngenerally believed.\\n\\n292. a philosopher: that is a man who constantly\\nexperiences, sees,\\nhears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary\\nthings; who is struck\\nby his own thoughts as if they came from the\\noutside, from above and\\nbelow, as a species of events and lightning-\\nflashes peculiar to him; who\\nis perhaps himself a storm pregnant with\\nnew lightnings; a portentous\\nman, around whom there is always rumbling\\nand mumbling and gaping and\\nsomething uncanny going on.  a\\nphilosopher: alas, a being who often\\nruns away from himself, is often\\nafraid of himself--but whose curiosity\\nalways makes him \"come to\\nhimself\" again.\\n\\n293. a man who says: \"i like that, i take it for my\\nown, and mean to\\nguard and protect it from every one\"; a man who can\\nconduct a case,\\ncarry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion,\\nkeep hold of a woman,\\npunish and overthrow insolence; a man who has\\nhis indignation and his\\nsword, and to whom the weak, the suffering,\\nthe oppressed, and even the\\nanimals willingly submit and naturally\\nbelong; in short, a man who is a\\nmaster by nature--when such a man has\\nsympathy, well!  that sympathy has\\nvalue!  but of what account is the\\nsympathy of those who suffer!  or of\\nthose even who preach sympathy!\\nthere is nowadays, throughout almost the\\nwhole of europe, a sickly\\nirritability and sensitiveness towards pain,\\nand also a repulsive\\nirrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing,\\nwhich, with the\\naid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks\\nto deck itself out\\nas something superior--there is a regular cult of\\nsuffering.  the\\nunmanliness of that which is called \"sympathy\" by such\\ngroups of\\nvisionaries, is always, i believe, the first thing that\\nstrikes the\\neye.--one must resolutely and radically taboo this latest\\nform of bad\\ntaste; and finally i wish people to put the good amulet,\\n\"gai saber\"\\n(\"gay science,\" in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as\\na\\nprotection against it.\\n\\n294. the olympian vice.--despite the\\nphilosopher who, as a genuine\\nenglishman, tried to bring laughter into\\nbad repute in all thinking\\nminds--\"laughing is a bad infirmity of\\nhuman nature, which every\\nthinking mind will strive to overcome\"\\n(hobbes),--i would even\\nallow myself to rank philosophers according to\\nthe quality of their\\nlaughing--up to those who are capable of golden\\nlaughter.  and supposing\\nthat gods also philosophize, which i am\\nstrongly inclined to believe,\\nowing to many reasons--i have no doubt\\nthat they also know how to laugh\\nthereby in an overman-like and new\\nfashion--and at the expense of all\\nserious things!  gods are fond of\\nridicule: it seems that they cannot\\nrefrain from laughter even in holy\\nmatters.\\n\\n295. the genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one\\npossesses\\nit, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences,\\nwhose voice can\\ndescend into the nether-world of every soul, who\\nneither speaks a word\\nnor casts a glance in which there may not be\\nsome motive or touch\\nof allurement, to whose perfection it pertains\\nthat he knows how to\\nappear,--not as he is, but in a guise which acts\\nas an additional\\nconstraint on his followers to press ever closer to\\nhim, to follow him\\nmore cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the\\nheart, which imposes\\nsilence and attention on everything loud and\\nself-conceited, which\\nsmoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new\\nlonging--to lie placid\\nas a mirror, that the deep heavens may be\\nreflected in them;--the genius\\nof the heart, which teaches the clumsy\\nand too hasty hand to hesitate,\\nand to grasp more delicately; which\\nscents the hidden and forgotten\\ntreasure, the drop of goodness and\\nsweet spirituality under thick dark\\nice, and is a divining-rod for\\nevery grain of gold, long buried and\\nimprisoned in mud and sand; the\\ngenius of the heart, from contact with\\nwhich every one goes away\\nricher; not favoured or surprised, not as\\nthough gratified and\\noppressed by the good things of others; but richer\\nin himself, newer\\nthan before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a\\nthawing wind;\\nmore uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more\\nbruised,\\nbut full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will\\nand\\ncurrent, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am i\\ndoing, my friends?  of whom am i talking to you?  have i forgotten\\nmyself\\nso far that i have not even told you his name?  unless it be\\nthat you\\nhave already divined of your own accord who this questionable\\ngod\\nand spirit is, that wishes to be praised in such a manner?  for,\\nas it\\nhappens to every one who from childhood onward has always been\\non his\\nlegs, and in foreign lands, i have also encountered on my path\\nmany\\nstrange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and\\nagain,\\nthe one of whom i have just spoken: in fact, no less a\\npersonage than\\nthe god dionysus, the great equivocator and tempter, to\\nwhom, as you\\nknow, i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my\\nfirst-fruits--the\\nlast, as it seems to me, who has offered a sacrifice\\nto him, for i\\nhave found no one who could understand what i was then\\ndoing.  in\\nthe meantime, however, i have learned much, far too much,\\nabout the\\nphilosophy of this god, and, as i said, from mouth to mouth\\n--i, the last\\ndisciple and initiate of the god dionysus: and perhaps i\\nmight at last\\nbegin to give you, my friends, as far as i am allowed, a\\nlittle taste of\\nthis philosophy?  in a hushed voice, as is but seemly:\\nfor it has to do\\nwith much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful,\\nand uncanny.  the\\nvery fact that dionysus is a philosopher, and that\\ntherefore gods also\\nphilosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not\\nunensnaring, and might\\nperhaps arouse suspicion precisely among\\nphilosophers;--among you, my\\nfriends, there is less to be said against\\nit, except that it comes too\\nlate and not at the right time; for, as\\nit has been disclosed to me, you\\nare loth nowadays to believe in god\\nand gods.  it may happen, too, that\\nin the frankness of my story i\\nmust go further than is agreeable to the\\nstrict usages of your ears?\\ncertainly the god in question went further,\\nvery much further, in such\\ndialogues, and was always many paces ahead of\\nme... indeed, if it were\\nallowed, i should have to give him, according\\nto human usage, fine\\nceremonious tides of lustre and merit, i should\\nhave to extol his\\ncourage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless\\nhonesty,\\ntruthfulness, and love of wisdom.  but such a god does not know\\nwhat\\nto do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp.  \"keep that,\" he\\nwould say, \"for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require\\nit!  i--have no reason to cover my nakedness!\"  one suspects that this\\nkind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--he once said:\\n\"under certain circumstances i love mankind\"--and referred thereby to\\nariadne, who was present; \"in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,\\ninventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way\\neven through all labyrinths.  i like man, and often think how i can\\nstill further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more\\nprofound.\"--\"stronger, more evil, and more profound?\"  i asked in\\nhorror.\\n\"yes,\" he said again, \"stronger, more evil, and more profound;\\nalso more\\nbeautiful\"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his\\nhalcyon smile,\\nas though he had just paid some charming compliment.\\none here sees at\\nonce that it is not only shame that this divinity\\nlacks;--and in general\\nthere are good grounds for supposing that in\\nsome things the gods could\\nall of them come to us men for instruction.\\nwe men are--more human.--\\n\\n296. alas!  what are you, after all, my\\nwritten and painted thoughts!  not\\nlong ago you were so variegated,\\nyoung and malicious, so full of

\"birth of\\ntragedy\" to the recently published \"prelude to a\\nphilosophy of the\\nfuture\": they all contain, i have been told, snares\\nand nets for short\\nsighted birds, and something that is almost a\\nconstant, subtle,\\nincitement to an overturning of habitual opinions and\\nof approved\\ncustoms.  what!? everything is merely--human--all too human?\\nwith this\\nexclamation my writings are gone through, not without a\\ncertain dread\\nand mistrust of ethic itself and not without a disposition\\nto ask the\\nexponent of evil things if those things be not simply\\nmisrepresented.\\nmy writings have been termed a school of distrust, still\\nmore of\\ndisdain: also, and more happily, of courage, audacity even.  and\\nin\\nfact, i myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the world\\nwith a distrust as deep as mine, seeming, as i do, not simply the\\ntimely\\nadvocate of the devil, but, to employ theological terms, an\\nenemy and\\nchallenger of god; and whosoever has experienced any of the\\nconsequences\\nof such deep distrust, anything of the chills and the\\nagonies of\\nisolation to which such an unqualified difference of\\nstandpoint condemns\\nhim endowed with it, will also understand how\\noften i must have sought\\nrelief and self-forgetfulness from any source\\n--through any object of\\nveneration or enmity, of scientific\\nseriousness or wanton lightness;\\nalso why i, when i could not find\\nwhat i was in need of, had to fashion\\nit for myself, counterfeiting it\\nor imagining it (and what poet or\\nwriter has ever done anything else,\\nand what other purpose can all the\\nart in the world possibly have?)\\nthat which i always stood most in need\\nof in order to effect my cure\\nand self-recovery was faith, faith enough\\nnot to be thus isolated, not\\nto look at life from so singular a point of\\nview--a magic apprehension\\n(in eye and mind) of relationship and\\nequality, a calm confidence in\\nfriendship, a blindness, free from\\nsuspicion and questioning, to two\\nsidedness; a pleasure in externals,\\nsuperficialities, the near, the\\naccessible, in all things possessed of\\ncolor, skin and seeming.\\nperhaps i could be fairly reproached with much\\n\"art\" in this regard,\\nmany fine counterfeitings; for example, that,\\nwisely or wilfully, i\\nhad shut my eyes to schopenhauer\\'s blind will\\ntowards ethic, at a time\\nwhen i was already clear sighted enough on the\\nsubject of ethic;\\nlikewise that i had deceived myself concerning richard\\nwagner\\'s\\nincurable romanticism, as if it were a beginning and not an\\nend;\\nlikewise concerning the greeks, likewise concerning the germans and\\ntheir future--and there may be, perhaps, a long list of such\\nlikewises.\\ngranted, however, that all this were true, and with justice\\nurged\\nagainst me, what does it signify, what can it signify in regard\\nto how\\nmuch of the self-sustaining capacity, how much of reason and\\nhigher\\nprotection are embraced in such self-deception?--and how much\\nmore\\nfalsity is still necessary to me that i may therewith always\\nreassure\\nmyself regarding the luxury of my truth.  enough, i still\\nlive; and life\\nis not considered now apart from ethic; it _will_\\n[have] deception; it\\nthrives (lebt) on deception ... but am i not\\nbeginning to do all over\\nagain what i have always done, i, the old\\nimmoralist, and bird\\nsnarer--talk unmorally, ultramorally, \"beyond\\ngood and evil\"?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nthus, then, have i evolved for myself the \"free\\nspirits\" to whom this\\ndiscouraging-encouraging work, under the general\\ntitle \"human, all too\\nhuman,\" is dedicated.  such \"free spirits\" do\\nnot really exist and never\\ndid exist.  but i stood in need of them, as\\ni have pointed out, in order\\nthat some good might be mixed with my\\nevils (illness, loneliness,\\nstrangeness, _acedia_, incapacity): to\\nserve as gay spirits and\\ncomrades, with whom one may talk and laugh\\nwhen one is disposed to talk\\nand laugh, and whom one may send to the\\ndevil when they grow wearisome.\\nthey are some compensation for the\\nlack of friends.  that such free\\nspirits can possibly exist, that our\\neurope will yet number among her\\nsons of to-morrow or of the day after\\nto-morrow, such a brilliant and\\nenthusiastic company, alive and\\npalpable and not merely, as in my case,\\nfantasms and imaginary shades,\\ni, myself, can by no means doubt.  i see\\nthem already coming, slowly,\\nslowly.  may it not be that i am doing a\\nlittle something to expedite\\ntheir coming when i describe in advance the\\ninfluences under which i\\nsee them evolving and the ways along which they\\ntravel?\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nit may be\\nconjectured that a soul in which the type of \"free spirit\" can\\nattain\\nmaturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event in\\nthe\\nform of a great emancipation or unbinding, and that prior to that\\nevent it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its place\\nand pillar.  what binds strongest?  what cords seem almost\\nunbreakable?  in\\nthe case of mortals of a choice and lofty nature they\\nwill be those of\\nduty: that reverence, which in youth is most typical,\\nthat timidity and\\ntenderness in the presence of the traditionally\\nhonored and the worthy,\\nthat gratitude to the soil from which we\\nsprung, for the hand that\\nguided us, for the relic before which we\\nwere taught to pray--their\\nsublimest moments will themselves bind\\nthese souls most strongly.  the\\ngreat liberation comes suddenly to\\nsuch prisoners, like an earthquake:\\nthe young soul is all at once\\nshaken, torn apart, cast forth--it\\ncomprehends not itself what is\\ntaking place.  an involuntary onward\\nimpulse rules them with the\\nmastery of command; a will, a wish are\\ndeveloped to go forward,\\nanywhere, at any price; a strong, dangerous\\ncuriosity regarding an\\nundiscovered world flames and flashes in all\\ntheir being.  \"better to\\ndie than live _here_\"--so sounds the tempting\\nvoice: and this \"here,\"\\nthis \"at home\" constitutes all they have\\nhitherto loved.  a sudden\\ndread and distrust of that which they loved, a\\nflash of contempt for\\nthat which is called their \"duty,\" a mutinous,\\nwilful, volcanic-like\\nlonging for a far away journey, strange scenes and\\npeople,\\nannihilation, petrifaction, a hatred surmounting love, perhaps a\\nsacrilegious impulse and look backwards, to where they so long prayed\\nand loved, perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the same\\ntime an exultation at having done it, an inner, intoxicating,\\ndelightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victory--a\\nvictory?\\nover what?  over whom?  a riddle-like victory, fruitful in\\nquestioning and\\nwell worth questioning, but the _first_ victory, for\\nall--such things of\\npain and ill belong to the history of the great\\nliberation.  and it is at\\nthe same time a malady that can destroy a\\nman, this first outbreak of\\nstrength and will for self-destination,\\nself-valuation, this will for\\nfree will: and how much illness is\\nforced to the surface in the frantic\\nstrivings and singularities with\\nwhich the freedman, the liberated seeks\\nhenceforth to attest his\\nmastery over things!  he roves fiercely around,\\nwith an unsatisfied\\nlonging and whatever objects he may encounter must\\nsuffer from the\\nperilous expectancy of his pride; he tears to pieces\\nwhatever attracts\\nhim.  with a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever he\\nfinds veiled or\\nprotected by any reverential awe: he would see what\\nthese things look\\nlike when they are overturned.  it is wilfulness and\\ndelight in the\\nwilfulness of it, if he now, perhaps, gives his approval\\nto that which\\nhas heretofore been in ill repute--if, in curiosity and\\nexperiment, he\\npenetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things.  in\\nthe background\\nduring all his plunging and roaming--for he is as\\nrestless and aimless\\nin his course as if lost in a wilderness--is the\\ninterrogation mark of\\na curiosity growing ever more dangerous.  \"can we\\nnot upset every\\nstandard?  and is good perhaps evil?  and god only an\\ninvention and a\\nsubtlety of the devil?  is everything, in the last\\nresort, false?  and\\nif we are dupes are we not on that very account\\ndupers also?  _must_\\nwe not be dupers also?\"  such reflections lead and\\nmislead him, ever\\nfurther on, ever further away.  solitude, that dread\\ngoddess and mater\\nsaeva cupidinum, encircles and besets him, ever more\\nthreatening, more\\nviolent, more heart breaking--but who to-day knows\\nwhat solitude is?\\n4\\n\\nfrom this morbid solitude, from the deserts of such trial years,\\nthe way\\nis yet far to that great, overflowing certainty and\\nhealthiness which\\ncannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a\\ngrappling hook of\\nknowledge; to that matured freedom of the spirit\\nwhich is, in an equal\\ndegree, self mastery and discipline of the\\nheart, and gives access to\\nthe path of much and various reflection--to\\nthat inner comprehensiveness\\nand self satisfaction of over-richness\\nwhich precludes all danger that\\nthe spirit has gone astray even in its\\nown path and is sitting\\nintoxicated in some corner or other; to that\\noverplus of plastic,\\nhealing, imitative and restorative power which is\\nthe very sign of\\nvigorous health, that overplus which confers upon the\\nfree spirit the\\nperilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment\\nand of running\\nadventurous risks: the past-master-privilege of the\\nfree spirit.  in the\\ninterval there may be long years of\\nconvalescence, years filled with\\nmany hued painfully-bewitching\\ntransformations, dominated and led to the\\ngoal by a tenacious will for\\nhealth that is often emboldened to assume\\nthe guise and the disguise\\nof health.  there is a middle ground to this,\\nwhich a man of such\\ndestiny can not subsequently recall without emotion;\\nhe basks in a\\nspecial fine sun of his own, with a feeling of birdlike\\nfreedom,\\nbirdlike visual power, birdlike irrepressibleness, a something\\nextraneous (drittes) in which curiosity and delicate disdain have\\nunited.  a \"free spirit\"--this refreshing term is grateful in any\\nmood,\\nit almost sets one aglow.  one lives--no longer in the bonds of\\nlove and\\nhate, without a yes or no, here or there indifferently, best\\npleased to\\nevade, to avoid, to beat about, neither advancing nor\\nretreating.  one is\\nhabituated to the bad, like a person who all at\\nonce sees a fearful\\nhurly-burly _beneath_ him--and one was the\\ncounterpart of him who\\nbothers himself with things that do not concern\\nhim.  as a matter of fact\\nthe free spirit is bothered with mere things\\n--and how many\\nthings--which no longer _concern_ him.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\na step\\nfurther in recovery: and the free spirit draws near to life\\nagain,\\nslowly indeed, almost refractorily, almost distrustfully.  there\\nis\\nagain warmth and mellowness: feeling and fellow feeling acquire\\ndepth,\\nlambent airs stir all about him.  he almost feels: it seems as if\\nnow\\nfor the first time his eyes are open to things _near_. he is in\\namaze\\nand sits hushed: for where had he been?  these near and immediate\\nthings: how changed they seem to him!  he looks gratefully back--\\ngrateful\\nfor his wandering, his self exile and severity, his lookings\\nafar and\\nhis bird flights in the cold heights.  how fortunate that he\\nhas not,\\nlike a sensitive, dull home body, remained always \"in the\\nhouse\" and \"at\\nhome!\"  he had been beside himself, beyond a doubt.\\nnow for the first\\ntime he really sees himself--and what surprises in\\nthe process.  what\\nhitherto unfelt tremors!  yet what joy in the\\nexhaustion, the old\\nsickness, the relapses of the convalescent!  how\\nit delights him,\\nsuffering, to sit still, to exercise patience, to lie\\nin the sun!  who so\\nwell as he appreciates the fact that there comes\\nbalmy weather even in\\nwinter, who delights more in the sunshine\\nathwart the wall?  they are\\nthe most appreciative creatures in the\\nworld, and also the most humble,\\nthese convalescents and lizards,\\ncrawling back towards life: there are\\nsome among them who can let no\\nday slip past them without addressing\\nsome song of praise to its\\nretreating light.  and speaking seriously, it\\nis a fundamental cure\\nfor all pessimism (the cankerous vice, as is well\\nknown, of all\\nidealists and humbugs), to become ill in the manner of\\nthese free\\nspirits, to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit grow\\nhealthy\\n--i mean healthier.  it is wisdom, worldly wisdom, to administer\\neven\\nhealth to oneself for a long time in small doses.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nabout this time\\nit becomes at last possible, amid the flash lights of a\\nstill\\nunestablished, still precarious health, for the free, the ever\\nfreer\\nspirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation, a\\nriddle\\nwhich has hitherto lingered, obscure, well worth questioning,\\nalmost\\nimpalpable, in his memory.  if once he hardly dared to ask \"why so\\napart?  so alone?  renouncing all i loved?  renouncing respect itself?\\nwhy\\nthis coldness, this suspicion, this hate for one\\'s very virtues?\"\\n--now\\nhe dares, and asks it loudly, already hearing the answer, \"you\\nhad to\\nbecome master over yourself, master of your own good qualities.\\nformerly\\nthey were your masters: but they should be merely your tools\\nalong with\\nother tools.  you had to acquire power over your aye and no\\nand learn to\\nhold and withhold them in accordance with your higher\\naims.  you had to\\ngrasp the perspective of every representation\\n(werthschätzung)--the\\ndislocation, distortion and the apparent end or\\nteleology of the\\nhorizon, besides whatever else appertains to the\\nperspective: also the\\nelement of demerit in its relation to opposing\\nmerit, and the whole\\nintellectual cost of every affirmative, every\\nnegative.  you had to find\\nout the _inevitable_ error[1] in every yes\\nand in every no, error as\\ninseparable from life, life itself as\\nconditioned by the perspective and\\nits inaccuracy.[1] above all, you\\nhad to see with your own eyes where\\nthe error[1] is always greatest:\\nthere, namely, where life is littlest,\\nnarrowest, meanest, least\\ndeveloped and yet cannot help looking upon\\nitself as the goal and\\nstandard of things, and smugly and ignobly and\\nincessantly tearing to\\ntatters all that is highest and greatest and\\nrichest, and putting the\\nshreds into the form of questions from the\\nstandpoint of its own well\\nbeing.  you had to see with your own eyes the\\nproblem of\\nclassification, (rangordnung, regulation concerning rank and\\nstation)\\nand how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upward\\ntogether: you had\"--enough, the free spirit knows henceforward which\\n\"you had\" it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now,\\nfor\\nthe first time, _dare_.\\n\\n[1]

by generalizing upon its\\nexperience in the following\\nfashion: \"what i went through everyone must\\ngo through\" in whom any\\nproblem is germinated and strives to body itself\\nforth.  the inner\\npower and inevitability of this problem will assert\\nthemselves in due\\ncourse, as in the case of any unsuspected\\npregnancy--long before the\\nspirit has seen this problem in its true\\naspect and learned to call it\\nby its right name.  our destiny exercises\\nits influence over us even\\nwhen, as yet, we have not learned its nature:\\nit is our future that\\nlays down the law to our to-day.  granted, that it\\nis the problem of\\nclassification[2] of which we free spirits may say,\\nthis is _our_\\nproblem, yet it is only now, in the midday of our life,\\nthat we fully\\nappreciate what preparations, shifts, trials, ordeals,\\nstages, were\\nessential to that problem before it could emerge to our\\nview, and why\\nwe had to go through the various and contradictory\\nlongings and\\nsatisfactions of body and soul, as circumnavigators and\\nadventurers of\\nthat inner world called \"man\"; as surveyors of that\\n\"higher\" and of\\nthat \"progression\"[3] that is also called\\n\"man\"--crowding in\\neverywhere, almost without fear, disdaining nothing,\\nmissing nothing,\\ntesting everything, sifting everything and eliminating\\nthe chance\\nimpurities--until at last we could say, we free spirits:\\n\"here--a\\n_new_ problem!  here, a long ladder on the rungs of which we\\nourselves\\nhave rested and risen, which we have actually been at times.\\nhere is a\\nsomething higher, a something deeper, a something below us, a\\nvastly\\nextensive order, (ordnung) a comparative classification\\n(rangordnung),\\nthat we perceive:

unhappily for one who in this\\nmatter is fashioned and mentored\\nin an un-german school!  this _german_\\nbook, which has found its\\nreaders in a wide circle of lands and\\npeoples--it has been some ten\\nyears on its rounds--and which must make\\nits way by means of any\\nmusical art and tune that will captivate the\\nforeign ear as well as\\nthe native--this book has been read

proverb says,\\none remains\\na philosopher only because one says--nothing!\\n\\nnice, spring, 1886.\\nof the first and last things.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n=chemistry of the notions and the\\nfeelings.=--philosophical problems, in\\nalmost all their aspects,\\npresent themselves in the same interrogative\\nformula now that they did\\ntwo thousand years ago: how can a thing\\ndevelop out of its antithesis?\\nfor example, the reasonable from the\\nnon-reasonable, the animate from\\nthe inanimate, the logical from the\\nillogical, altruism from egoism,\\ndisinterestedness from greed, truth\\nfrom error?  the metaphysical\\nphilosophy formerly steered itself clear of\\nthis difficulty to such\\nextent as to repudiate the evolution of one\\nthing from another and to\\nassign a miraculous origin to what it deemed\\nhighest and best, due to\\nthe very nature and being of the\\n\"thing-in-itself.\"  the historical\\nphilosophy, on the other hand, which\\ncan no longer be viewed apart\\nfrom physical science, the youngest of all\\nphilosophical methods,\\ndiscovered experimentally (and its results will\\nprobably always be the\\nsame) that there is no antithesis whatever,\\nexcept in the usual\\nexaggerations of popular or metaphysical\\ncomprehension, and that an\\nerror of the reason is at the bottom of such\\ncontradiction.  according\\nto its explanation, there is, strictly\\nspeaking, neither unselfish\\nconduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of\\nview.  both are simply\\nsublimations in which the basic element seems\\nalmost evaporated and\\nbetrays its presence only to the keenest\\nobservation.  all that we\\nneed and that could possibly be given us in the\\npresent state of\\ndevelopment of the sciences, is a chemistry of the\\nmoral, religious,\\naesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those\\nemotions which\\nwe experience in the affairs, great and small, of society\\nand\\ncivilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude.  but\\nwhat\\nif this chemistry established the fact that, even in _its_ domain,\\nthe\\nmost magnificent results were attained with the basest and most\\ndespised ingredients?  would many feel disposed to continue such\\ninvestigations?  mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin\\nand\\nbeginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the\\nopposite course?\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n=the traditional error of philosophers.=--all\\nphilosophers make the\\ncommon mistake of taking contemporary man as\\ntheir starting point and of\\ntrying, through an analysis of him, to\\nreach a conclusion.  \"man\"\\ninvoluntarily presents himself to them as\\nan aeterna veritas as a\\npassive element in every hurly-burly, as a\\nfixed standard of things.  yet\\neverything uttered by the philosopher\\non the subject of man is, in the\\nlast resort, nothing more than a\\npiece of testimony concerning man\\nduring a very limited period of\\ntime.  lack of the historical sense is\\nthe traditional defect in all\\nphilosophers.  many innocently take man in\\nhis most childish state as\\nfashioned through the influence of certain\\nreligious and even of\\ncertain political developments, as the permanent\\nform under which man\\nmust be viewed.  they will not learn that man has\\nevolved,[4] that the\\nintellectual faculty itself is an evolution,\\nwhereas some philosophers\\nmake the whole cosmos out of this intellectual\\nfaculty.  but\\neverything essential in human evolution took place aeons\\nago, long\\nbefore the four thousand years or so of which we know\\nanything: during\\nthese man may not have changed very much.  however, the\\nphilosopher\\nascribes \"instinct\" to contemporary man and assumes that\\nthis is one\\nof the unalterable facts regarding man himself, and hence\\naffords a\\nclue to the understanding of the universe in general.  the\\nwhole\\nteleology is so planned that man during the last four thousand\\nyears\\nshall be spoken of as a being existing from all eternity, and\\nwith\\nreference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inception\\nis\\nnaturally ordered.  yet everything evolved: there are no eternal facts\\nas there are no absolute truths.  accordingly, historical\\nphilosophising\\nis henceforth indispensable, and with it honesty of\\njudgment.\\n\\n[4] geworden.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n=appreciation of simple truths.=--it is\\nthe characteristic of an\\nadvanced civilization to set a higher value\\nupon little, simple truths,\\nascertained by scientific method, than\\nupon the pleasing and magnificent\\nerrors originating in metaphysical\\nand æsthetical epochs and peoples.  to\\nbegin with, the former are\\nspoken of with contempt as if there could be\\nno question of comparison\\nrespecting them, so rigid, homely, prosaic and\\neven discouraging is\\nthe aspect of the first, while so beautiful,\\ndecorative, intoxicating\\nand perhaps beatific appear the last named.\\nnevertheless, the hardwon,\\nthe certain, the lasting and, therefore, the\\nfertile in new knowledge,\\nis the higher; to hold fast to it is manly and\\nevinces courage,\\ndirectness, endurance.  and not only individual men but\\nall mankind\\nwill by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they are\\nfinally\\nhabituated to the proper appreciation of tenable, enduring\\nknowledge\\nand have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculous\\nrevelation of truth.  the reverers of forms, indeed, with their\\nstandards\\nof beauty and taste, may have good reason to laugh when the\\nappreciation\\nof little truths and the scientific spirit begin to\\nprevail, but that\\nwill be only because their eyes are not yet opened\\nto the charm of the\\nutmost simplicity of form or because men though\\nreared in the rightly\\nappreciative spirit, will still not be fully\\npermeated by it, so that\\nthey continue unwittingly imitating ancient\\nforms (and that ill enough,\\nas anybody does who no longer feels any\\ninterest in a thing). formerly\\nthe mind was not brought into play\\nthrough the medium of exact thought.\\nits serious business lay in the\\nworking out of forms and symbols.  that\\nhas now changed.  any\\nseriousness in symbolism is at present the\\nindication of a deficient\\neducation.  as our very acts become more\\nintellectual, our tendencies\\nmore rational, and our judgment, for\\nexample, as to what seems\\nreasonable, is very different from what it was\\na hundred years ago: so\\nthe forms of our lives grow ever more\\nintellectual and, to the old\\nfashioned eye, perhaps, uglier, but only\\nbecause it cannot see that\\nthe richness of inner, rational beauty always\\nspreads and deepens, and\\nthat the inner, rational aspect of all things\\nshould now be of more\\nconsequence to us than the most beautiful\\nexternality and the most\\nexquisite limning.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n=astrology and the like.=--it is presumable\\nthat the objects of the\\nreligious, moral, aesthetic and logical\\nnotions pertain simply to the\\nsuperficialities of things, although man\\nflatters himself with the\\nthought that here at least he is getting to\\nthe heart of the cosmos.  he\\ndeceives himself because these things\\nhave power to make him so happy\\nand so wretched, and so he evinces, in\\nthis respect, the same conceit\\nthat characterises astrology.\\nastrology presupposes that the heavenly\\nbodies are regulated in their\\nmovements in harmony with the destiny of\\nmortals: the moral man\\npresupposes that that which concerns himself most\\nnearly must also be\\nthe heart and soul of things.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n=misconception of dreams.=--in the\\ndream, mankind, in epochs of crude\\nprimitive civilization, thought\\nthey were introduced to a second,\\nsubstantial world: here we have the\\nsource of all metaphysic.  without\\nthe dream, men would never have\\nbeen incited to an analysis of the\\nworld.  even the distinction\\nbetween soul and body is wholly due to the\\nprimitive conception of the\\ndream, as also the hypothesis of the\\nembodied soul, whence the\\ndevelopment of all superstition, and also,\\nprobably, the belief in\\ngod.  \"the dead still live: for they appear to\\nthe living in dreams.\"\\nso reasoned mankind at one time, and through many\\nthousands of years.\\n6\\n\\n=the scientific spirit prevails only partially, not wholly.=--the\\nspecialized, minutest departments of science are dealt with purely\\nobjectively.  but the general universal sciences, considered as a\\ngreat,\\nbasic unity, posit the question--truly a very living\\nquestion--: to what\\npurpose?  what is the use?  because of this\\nreference to utility they are,\\nas a whole, less impersonal than when\\nlooked at in their specialized\\naspects.  now in the case of\\nphilosophy, as forming the apex of the\\nscientific pyramid, this\\nquestion of the utility of knowledge is\\nnecessarily brought very\\nconspicuously forward, so that every philosophy\\nhas, unconsciously,\\nthe air of ascribing the highest utility to itself.\\nit is for this\\nreason that all philosophies contain such a great amount\\nof high\\nflying metaphysic, and such a shrinking from the seeming\\ninsignificance of the deliverances of physical science: for the\\nsignificance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear\\nas\\ngreat as possible.  this constitutes the antagonism between the\\nspecialties of science and philosophy.  the latter aims, as art aims,\\nat\\nimparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance: in\\nthe\\nformer mere knowledge is sought and nothing else--whatever else be\\nincidentally obtained.  heretofore there has never been a\\nphilosophical\\nsystem in which philosophy itself was not made the\\napologist of\\nknowledge [in the abstract]. on this point, at least,\\neach is optimistic\\nand insists that to knowledge the highest utility\\nmust be ascribed.  they\\nare all under the tyranny of logic, which is,\\nfrom its very nature,\\noptimism.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n=the discordant element in\\nscience.=--philosophy severed itself from\\nscience when it put the\\nquestion: what is that knowledge of the world\\nand of life through\\nwhich mankind may be made happiest?  this happened\\nwhen the socratic\\nschool arose: with the standpoint of _happiness_ the\\narteries of\\ninvestigating science were compressed too tightly to permit\\nof any\\ncirculation of the blood--and are so compressed to-day.\\n\\n\\n8\\n=pneumatic explanation of nature.=[5]--metaphysic reads the message of\\nnature as if it were written purely pneumatically, as the church and\\nits\\nlearned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned.  it\\nrequires a\\ngreat deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict\\nscience of\\ninterpretation that the philologists have devised for all\\nliterature,\\nand to apply it for the purpose of a simple, direct\\ninterpretation of\\nthe message, and at the same time, not bring out a\\ndouble meaning.  but,\\nas in the case of books and literature, errors\\nof exposition are far\\nfrom being completely eliminated, and vestiges\\nof allegorical and\\nmystical interpretations are still to be met with\\nin the most cultivated\\ncircles, so where nature is concerned the case\\nis--actually much worse.\\n\\n[5] pneumatic is here used in the sense of\\nspiritual.  pneuma being the\\ngreek word in the new testament for the\\nholy spirit.--ed.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n=metaphysical world.=--it is true, there may be\\na metaphysical world;\\nthe absolute possibility of it can scarcely be\\ndisputed.  we see all\\nthings through the medium of the human head and\\nwe cannot well cut off\\nthis head: although there remains the question\\nwhat part of the world\\nwould be left after it had been cut off.  but\\nthat is a purely abstract\\nscientific problem and one not much\\ncalculated to give men uneasiness:\\nyet everything that has heretofore\\nmade metaphysical assumptions\\nvaluable, fearful or delightful to men,\\nall that gave rise to them is\\npassion, error and self deception: the\\nworst systems of knowledge, not\\nthe best, pin their tenets of belief\\nthereto.  when such methods are once\\nbrought to view as the basis of\\nall existing religions and metaphysics,\\nthey are already discredited.\\nthere always remains, however, the\\npossibility already conceded: but\\nnothing at all can be made out of\\nthat, to say not a word about\\nletting happiness, salvation and life hang\\nupon the threads spun from\\nsuch a possibility.  accordingly, nothing\\ncould be predicated of the\\nmetaphysical world beyond the fact that it is\\nan elsewhere,[6] another\\nsphere, inaccessible and incomprehensible to\\nus: it would become a\\nthing of negative properties.  even were the\\nexistence of such a world\\nabsolutely established, it would nevertheless\\nremain incontrovertible\\nthat of all kinds of knowledge, knowledge of\\nsuch a world would be of\\nleast consequence--of even less consequence\\nthan knowledge of the\\nchemical analysis of water would be to a storm\\ntossed mariner.\\n\\n[6]\\nanderssein.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n=the harmlessness of metaphysic in the future.=--as\\nsoon as religion,\\nart and ethics are so understood that a full\\ncomprehension of them can\\nbe gained without taking refuge in the\\npostulates of metaphysical\\nclaptrap at any point in the line of\\nreasoning, there will be a complete\\ncessation of interest in the\\npurely theoretical problem of the \"thing in\\nitself\" and the\\n\"phenomenon.\"  for here, too, the same truth applies: in\\nreligion, art\\nand ethics we are not concerned with the \"essence of the\\ncosmos\".[7]\\nwe are in the sphere of pure conception.  no presentiment [or\\nintuition] can carry us any further.  with perfect tranquility the\\nquestion of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply\\nfrom\\nthe actual world as it is manifest to us, will be relegated to\\nthe\\nphysiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of\\nideas and\\norganisms.\\n\\n[7] \"wesen der welt an sich.\"\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n=language as\\na presumptive science.=--the importance of language in the\\ndevelopment\\nof civilization consists in the fact that by means of it\\nman placed\\none world, his own, alongside another, a place of leverage\\nthat he\\nthought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of the\\ncosmos on a\\npivot that he might master it.  in so far as man for ages\\nlooked upon\\nmere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritates,\\nhe evinced\\nthe very pride with which he raised himself above the brute.\\nhe really\\nsupposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of the\\ncosmos.  the\\nlanguage builder was not so modest as to believe that he was\\nonly\\ngiving names to things.  on the contrary he thought he embodied the\\nhighest wisdom concerning things in [mere] words; and, in truth,\\nlanguage is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom.  here,\\ntoo,\\nit is _faith in ascertained truth_[8] from which the mightiest\\nfountains\\nof strength have flowed.  very tardily--only now--it dawns\\nupon men that\\nthey have propagated a monstrous error in their belief\\nin language.\\nfortunately, it is too late now to arrest and turn back\\nthe evolutionary\\nprocess of the reason, which had its inception in\\nthis belief.  logic\\nitself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in\\nthe world of reality\\ncorresponds.  for example, the correspondence of\\ncertain things to one\\nanother and the identity of those things at\\ndifferent periods of time\\nare assumptions pure and simple, but the\\nscience of logic originated in\\nthe positive belief that they were not\\nassumptions at all but\\nestablished facts.  it is the same with the\\nscience of mathematics which\\ncertainly would never have come into\\nexistence if mankind had known from\\nthe beginning that in all nature\\nthere is no perfectly straight line, no\\ntrue circle, no standard of\\nmeasurement.\\n\\n[8] glaube an die gefundene wahrheit, as distinguished\\nfrom faith in\\nwhat is taken on trust as truth.\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n=dream and\\ncivilization.=--the function of the brain which is most\\nencroached\\nupon in slumber is the memory; not that it is wholly\\nsuspended, but it\\nis reduced to a state of imperfection as, in primitive\\nages of\\nmankind, was probably the case with everyone, whether waking or\\nsleeping.  uncontrolled and entangled as it is, it perpetually\\nconfuses\\nthings as a result of the most trifling similarities, yet in\\nthe same\\nmental confusion and lack of control the nations invented\\ntheir\\nmythologies, while nowadays travelers habitually observe how\\nprone the\\nsavage is to forgetfulness, how his mind, after the least\\nexertion of\\nmemory, begins to wander and lose itself until finally he\\nutters\\nfalsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion.  yet, in dreams,\\nwe all\\nresemble this savage.  inadequacy of distinction and error of\\ncomparison\\nare the basis of the preposterous things we do and say in\\ndreams, so\\nthat when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so\\nmuch idiocy\\nlurks within us.  the absolute distinctness of all dream-\\nimages, due to\\nimplicit faith in their substantial reality, recalls\\nthe conditions in\\nwhich earlier mankind were placed, for whom\\nhallucinations had\\nextraordinary vividness, entire communities and\\neven entire nations\\nlaboring simultaneously under them.  therefore: in\\nsleep and in dream we\\nmake the pilgrimage of early mankind over again.\\n13\\n\\n=logic of the dream.=--during sleep the nervous system, through\\nvarious\\ninner provocatives, is in constant agitation.  almost all the\\norgans act\\nindependently and vigorously.  the blood circulates\\nrapidly.  the posture\\nof the sleeper compresses some portions of the\\nbody.  the coverlets\\ninfluence the sensations in different ways.  the\\nstomach carries on the\\ndigestive process and acts upon other organs\\nthereby.  the intestines are\\nin motion.  the position of the head\\ninduces unaccustomed action.  the\\nfeet, shoeless, no longer pressing\\nthe ground, are the occasion of other\\nsensations of novelty, as is,\\nindeed, the changed garb of the entire\\nbody.  all these things,\\nfollowing the bustle and change of the day,\\nresult, through their\\nnovelty, in a movement throughout the entire\\nsystem that extends even\\nto the brain functions.  thus there are a\\nhundred circumstances to\\ninduce perplexity in the mind, a questioning as\\nto the cause of this\\nexcitation.  now, the dream is a _seeking and\\npresenting of reasons_\\nfor these excitations of feeling, of the supposed\\nreasons, that is to\\nsay.  thus, for example, whoever has his feet bound\\nwith two threads\\nwill probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiled\\nabout his feet.\\nthis is at first a hypothesis, then a belief with an\\naccompanying\\nimaginative picture and the argument: \"these snakes must be\\nthe\\n_causa_ of those sensations which i, the sleeper, now have.\"  so\\nreasons the mind of the sleeper.  the conditions precedent, as thus\\nconjectured, become, owing to the excitation of the fancy, present\\nrealities.  everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will\\ntransform\\none piercing sound, for example, that of a bell, into\\nanother of quite a\\ndifferent nature, say, the report of cannon.  in\\nhis dream he becomes\\naware first of the effects, which he explains by\\na subsequent hypothesis\\nand becomes persuaded of the purely\\nconjectural nature of the sound.  but\\nhow comes it that the mind of\\nthe dreamer goes so far astray when the\\nsame mind, awake, is\\nhabitually cautious, careful, and so conservative\\nin its dealings with\\nhypotheses?  why does the first plausible\\nhypothesis of the cause of a\\nsensation gain credit in the dreaming\\nstate?  (for in a dream we look\\nupon that dream as reality, that is, we\\naccept our hypotheses as fully\\nestablished). i have no doubt that as men\\nargue in their dreams to-\\nday, mankind argued, even in their waking\\nmoments, for thousands of\\nyears: the first _causa_, that occurred to the\\nmind with reference to\\nanything that stood in need of explanation, was\\naccepted as the true\\nexplanation and served as such.  (savages show the\\nsame tendency in\\noperation, as the reports of travelers agree). in the\\ndream this\\natavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within\\nus, for it\\nis the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty\\ndeveloped\\nitself and still develops itself in every individual.  dreams\\ncarry us\\nback to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us a\\nmeans of\\nunderstanding it more clearly.  dream thought comes so easily to\\nus\\nnow because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the\\ninterminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facile\\nform of theorising has prevailed.  to a certain extent the dream is a\\nrestorative for the brain, which, during the day, is called upon to\\nmeet\\nthe many demands for trained thought made upon it by the\\nconditions of a\\nhigher civilization.--we may, if we please, become\\nsensible, even in our\\nwaking moments, of a condition that is as a door\\nand vestibule to\\ndreaming.  if we close our eyes the brain immediately\\nconjures up a\\nmedley of impressions of light and color, apparently a\\nsort of imitation\\nand echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain\\nduring its waking\\nmoments.  and now the mind, in co-operation with the\\nimagination,\\ntransforms this formless play of light and color into\\ndefinite figures,\\nmoving groups, landscapes.  what really takes place\\nis a sort of\\nreasoning from effect back to cause.  as the brain\\ninquires: whence these\\nimpressions of light and color?  it posits as\\nthe inducing causes of such\\nlights and colors, those shapes and\\nfigures.  they serve the brain as the\\noccasions of those lights and\\ncolors because the brain, when the eyes\\nare open and the senses awake,\\nis accustomed to perceiving the cause of\\nevery impression of light and\\ncolor made upon it.  here again the\\nimagination is continually\\ninterposing its images inasmuch as it\\nparticipates in the production\\nof the impressions made through the\\nsenses day by day: and the dream-\\nfancy does exactly the same thing--that\\nis, the presumed cause is\\ndetermined from the effect and _after_ the\\neffect: all this, too, with\\nextraordinary rapidity, so that in this\\nmatter, as in a matter of\\njugglery or sleight-of-hand, a confusion of\\nthe mind is produced and\\nan after effect is made to appear a\\nsimultaneous action, an inverted\\nsuccession of events, even.--from\\nthese considerations we can see how\\n_late_ strict, logical thought, the\\ntrue notion of cause and effect\\nmust have been in developing, since our\\nintellectual and rational\\nfaculties to this very day revert to these\\nprimitive processes of\\ndeduction, while practically half our lifetime is\\nspent in the super-\\ninducing conditions.--even the poet, the artist,\\nascribes to his\\nsentimental and emotional states causes which are not\\nthe true ones.\\nto that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and can\\naid us in its\\ncomprehension.\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n=association.=[9]--all strong feelings are\\nassociated with a variety of\\nallied sentiments and emotions.  they\\nstir up the memory at the same\\ntime.  when we are under their\\ninfluence we are reminded of similar\\nstates and we feel a renewal of\\nthem within us.  thus are formed habitual\\nsuccessions of feelings and\\nnotions, which, at last, when they follow\\none another with lightning\\nrapidity are no longer felt as complexities\\nbut as unities.  in this\\nsense we hear of moral feelings, of religious\\nfeelings, as if they\\nwere absolute unities.  in reality they are streams\\nwith a hundred\\nsources and tributaries.  here again, the unity of the\\nword speaks\\nnothing for the unity of the thing.\\n\\n[9] miterklingen: to sound\\nsimultaneously with.\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n=no within and without in the\\nworld.=[10]--as democritus transferred the\\nnotions above and below to\\nlimitless space, where they are destitute of\\nmeaning, so the\\nphilosophers do generally with the idea \"within and\\nwithout,\" as\\nregards the form and substance (wesen und erscheinung) of\\nthe world.\\nwhat they claim is that through the medium of profound\\nfeelings one\\ncan penetrate deep into the soul of things (innre), draw\\nclose to the\\nheart of nature.  but these feelings are deep only in so far\\nas with\\nthem are simultaneously aroused, although almost imperceptibly,\\ncertain complicated groups of thoughts (gedankengruppen) which we call\\ndeep: a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying it\\ndeep.  but deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered from\\ntruth, as for instance every metaphysical thought.  take from deep\\nfeeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is\\n_strength_ of feeling which is no voucher for the validity of\\nknowledge, as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity and\\nnot of the truth of that in which the faith is felt.\\n\\n[10] kein innen\\nund aussen in der welt: the above translation may seem\\ntoo literal but\\nsome dispute has arisen concerning the precise idea the\\nauthor means\\nto convey.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n=phenomenon and thing-in-itself.=--the philosophers\\nare in the habit of\\nplacing themselves in front of life and experience\\n--that which they call\\nthe world of phenomena--as if they were\\nstanding before a picture that\\nis unrolled before them in its final\\ncompleteness.  this panorama, they\\nthink, must be studied in every\\ndetail in order to reach some conclusion\\nregarding the object\\nrepresented by the picture.  from effect,\\naccordingly is deduced cause\\nand from cause is deduced the\\nunconditioned.  this process is\\ngenerally looked upon as affording the\\nall sufficient explanation of\\nthe world of phenomena.  on the other hand\\none must, (while putting\\nthe conception of the metaphysical distinctly\\nforward as that of the\\nunconditioned, and consequently of the\\nunconditioning) absolutely deny\\nany connection between the unconditioned\\n(of the metaphysical world)\\nand the world known to us: so that\\nthroughout phenomena there is no\\nmanifestation of the thing-in-itself,\\nand getting from one to the\\nother is out of the question.  thus is left\\nquite ignored the\\ncircumstance that the picture--that which we now call\\nlife and\\nexperience--is a gradual evolution, is, indeed, still in\\nprocess of\\nevolution and for that reason should not be regarded as an\\nenduring\\nwhole from which any conclusion as to its author (the\\nall-sufficient\\nreason) could be arrived at, or even pronounced out of\\nthe question.\\nit is because we have for thousands of years looked into\\nthe world\\nwith moral, aesthetic, religious predispositions, with blind\\nprejudice, passion or fear, and surfeited ourselves with indulgence in\\nthe follies of illogical thought, that the world has gradually become\\nso\\nwondrously motley, frightful, significant, soulful: it has taken on\\ntints, but we have been the colorists: the human intellect, upon the\\nfoundation of human needs, of human passions, has reared all these\\n\"phenomena\" and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions\\ninto\\nthings.  late, very late, the human intellect checks itself: and\\nnow the\\nworld of experience and the thing-in-itself seem to it so\\nsevered and so\\nantithetical that it denies the possibility of one\\'s\\nhinging upon the\\nother--or else summons us to surrender our intellect,\\nour personal will,\\nto the secret and the awe-inspiring in order that\\nthereby we may attain\\ncertainty of certainty hereafter.  again, there\\nare those who have\\ncombined all the characteristic features of our\\nworld of\\nphenomena--that is, the conception of the world which has\\nbeen formed\\nand inherited through a series of intellectual vagaries--\\nand instead of\\nholding the intellect responsible for it all, have\\npronounced the very\\nnature of things accountable for the present very\\nsinister aspect of the\\nworld, and preached annihilation of existence.\\nthrough all these views\\nand opinions the toilsome, steady process of\\nscience (which now for the\\nfirst time begins to celebrate its greatest\\ntriumph in the genesis of\\nthought) will definitely work itself out,\\nthe result, being, perhaps, to\\nthe following effect: that which we now\\ncall the world is the result of\\na crowd of errors and fancies which\\ngradually developed in the general\\nevolution of organic nature, have\\ngrown together and been transmitted to\\nus as the accumulated treasure\\nof all the past--as the _treasure_, for\\nwhatever is worth anything in\\nour humanity rests upon it.  from this\\nworld of conception it is in\\nthe power of science to release us only to\\na slight extent--and this\\nis all that could be wished--inasmuch as it\\ncannot eradicate the\\ninfluence of hereditary habits of feeling, but it\\ncan light up by\\ndegrees the stages of the development of that world of\\nconception, and\\nlift us, at least for a time, above the whole spectacle.\\nperhaps we\\nmay then perceive that the thing-in-itself is a meet subject\\nfor\\nhomeric laughter: that it seemed so much, everything, indeed, and\\nis\\nreally a void--void, that is to say, of meaning.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n=metaphysical\\nexplanation.=--man, when he is young, prizes metaphysical\\nexplanations, because they make him see matters of the highest import\\nin\\nthings he found disagreeable or contemptible: and if he is not\\nsatisfied\\nwith himself, this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed\\nwhen he sees\\nthe most hidden world-problem or world-pain in that which\\nhe finds so\\ndispleasing in himself.  to feel himself more\\nunresponsible and at the\\nsame time to find things (dinge) more\\ninteresting--that is to him the\\ndouble benefit he owes to metaphysics.\\nlater, indeed, he acquires\\ndistrust of the whole metaphysical method\\nof explaining things: he then\\nperceives, perhaps, that those effects\\ncould have been attained just as\\nwell and more scientifically by\\nanother method: that physical and\\nhistorical explanations would, at\\nleast, have given that feeling of\\nfreedom from personal responsibility\\njust as well, while interest in\\nlife and its problems would be\\nstimulated, perhaps, even more.\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n=the fundamental problems of\\nmetaphysics.=--if a history of the\\ndevelopment of thought is ever\\nwritten, the following proposition,\\nadvanced by a distinguished\\nlogician, will be illuminated with a new\\nlight: \"the universal,\\nprimordial law of the apprehending subject\\nconsists in the inner\\nnecessity of cognizing every object by itself, as\\nin its essence a\\nthing unto itself, therefore as self-existing and\\nunchanging, in\\nshort, as a substance.\"  even this law, which is here\\ncalled\\n\"primordial,\" is an evolution: it has yet to be shown how\\ngradually\\nthis evolution takes place in lower organizations: how the\\ndim, mole\\neyes of such organizations see, at first, nothing but a blank\\nsameness: how later, when the various excitations of desire and\\naversion\\nmanifest themselves, various substances are gradually\\ndistinguished, but\\neach with an attribute, that is, a special\\nrelationship to such an\\norganization.  the first step towards the\\nlogical is judgment, the\\nessence of which, according to the best\\nlogicians, is belief.  at the\\nfoundation of all beliefs lie sensations\\nof pleasure or pain in relation\\nto the apprehending subject.  a third\\nfeeling, as the result of two\\nprior, single, separate feelings, is\\njudgment in its crudest form.  we\\norganic beings are primordially\\ninterested by nothing whatever in any\\nthing (ding) except its relation\\nto ourselves with reference to pleasure\\nand pain.  between the moments\\nin which we are conscious of this\\nrelation, (the states of feeling)\\nlie the moments of rest, of\\nnot-feeling: then the world and every\\nthing (ding) have no interest for\\nus: we observe no change in them (as\\nat present a person absorbed in\\nsomething does not notice anyone\\npassing by). to plants all things are,\\nas a rule, at rest, eternal,\\nevery object like itself.  from the period\\nof lower organisms has been\\nhanded down to man the belief that there are\\nlike things (gleiche\\ndinge): only the trained experience attained\\nthrough the most advanced\\nscience contradicts this postulate.  the\\nprimordial belief of all\\norganisms is, perhaps, that all the rest of the\\nworld is one thing and\\nmotionless.--furthest away from this first step\\ntowards the logical is\\nthe notion of causation: even to-day we think\\nthat all our feelings\\nand doings are, at bottom, acts of the free will;\\nwhen the sentient\\nindividual contemplates himself he deems every\\nfeeling, every change,\\na something isolated, disconnected, that is to\\nsay, unqualified by any\\nthing; it comes suddenly to the surface,\\nindependent of anything that\\nwent before or came after.  we are hungry,\\nbut originally we do not\\nknow that the organism must be nourished: on\\nthe contrary that feeling\\nseems to manifest itself without reason or\\npurpose; it stands out by\\nitself and seems quite independent.  therefore:\\nthe belief in the\\nfreedom of the will is a primordial error of\\neverything organic as old\\nas the very earliest inward prompting of the\\nlogical faculty; belief\\nin unconditioned substances and in like things\\n(gleiche dinge) is also\\na primordial and equally ancient error of\\neverything organic.\\ninasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itself\\nparticularly with\\nsubstance and with freedom of the will, it should be\\ndesignated as the\\nscience that deals with the fundamental errors of\\nmankind as if they\\nwere fundamental truths.\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n=number.=--the invention of the laws of\\nnumber has as its basis the\\nprimordial and prior-prevailing delusion\\nthat many like things exist\\n(although in point of fact there is no\\nsuch thing is a duplicate), or\\nthat, at least, there are things (but\\nthere is no \"thing\"). the\\nassumption of plurality always presupposes\\nthat _something_ exists which\\nmanifests itself repeatedly, but just\\nhere is where the delusion\\nprevails; in this very matter we feign\\nrealities, unities, that have no\\nexistence.  our feelings, notions, of\\nspace and time are false for they\\nlead, when duly tested, to logical\\ncontradictions.  in all scientific\\ndemonstrations we always\\nunavoidably base our calculation upon some\\nfalse standards [of\\nduration or measurement] but as these standards are\\nat least\\n_constant_, as, for example, our notions of time and space, the\\nresults arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty\\nin\\ntheir relationship to one another: one can keep on building upon\\nthem--until is reached that final limit at which the erroneous\\nfundamental conceptions, (the invariable breakdown) come into conflict\\nwith the results established--as, for example, in the case of the\\natomic\\ntheory.  here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence\\nto a\\n\"thing\" or material \"substratum\" that is set in motion, although,\\nat the\\nsame time, the whole scientific programme has had as its aim\\nthe\\nresolving of everything material into motions [themselves]: here\\nagain\\nwe distinguish with our feeling [that which does the] moving and\\n[that\\nwhich is] moved,[11] and we never get out of this circle,\\nbecause the\\nbelief in things[12] has been from time immemorial rooted\\nin our\\nnature.--when kant says \"the intellect does not derive its laws\\nfrom\\nnature, but dictates them to her\" he states the full truth as\\nregards\\nthe _idea of nature_ which we form (nature = world, as notion,\\nthat is,\\nas error) but which is merely the synthesis of a host of\\nerrors of the\\nintellect.  to a world not [the outcome of] our\\nconception, the laws of\\nnumber are wholly inapplicable: such laws are\\nvalid only in the world of\\nmankind.\\n\\n[11] wir scheiden auch hier noch\\nmit unserer empfindung bewegendes und\\nbewegtes.\\n\\n[12] glaube an dinge.\\n20\\n\\n=some backward steps.=--one very forward step in education is\\ntaken when\\nman emerges from his superstitious and religious ideas and\\nfears and,\\nfor instance, no longer believes in the dear little angels\\nor in\\noriginal sin, and has stopped talking about the salvation of the\\nsoul:\\nwhen he has taken this step to freedom he has, nevertheless,\\nthrough the\\nutmost exertion of his mental power, to overcome\\nmetaphysics.  then a\\nbackward movement is necessary: he must\\nappreciate the historical\\njustification, and to an equal extent the\\npsychological considerations,\\nin such a movement.  he must understand\\nthat the greatest advances made\\nby mankind have resulted from such a\\ncourse and that without this very\\nbackward movement the highest\\nachievements of man hitherto would have\\nbeen impossible.--with regard\\nto philosophical metaphysics i see ever\\nmore and more who have arrived\\nat the negative goal (that all positive\\nmetaphysic is a delusion) but\\nas yet very few who go a few steps\\nbackward: one should look out over\\nthe last rungs of the ladder, but not\\ntry to stand on them, that is to\\nsay.  the most advanced as yet go only\\nfar enough to free themselves\\nfrom metaphysic and look back at it with\\nan air of superiority:\\nwhereas here, no less than in the hippodrome, it\\nis necessary to turn\\naround in order to reach the end of the course.\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n=presumable\\n[nature of the] victory of doubt.=--let us assume for a\\nmoment the\\nvalidity of the skeptical standpoint: granted that there is\\nno\\nmetaphysical world, and that all the metaphysical explanations of the\\nonly world we know are useless to us, how would we then contemplate\\nmen\\nand things?  [menschen und dinge]. this can be thought out and it\\nis\\nworth while doing so, even if the question whether anything\\nmetaphysical\\nhas ever been demonstrated by or through kant and\\nschopenhauer, be put\\naltogether aside.  for it is, to all appearances,\\nhighly probable that\\nmen, on this point, will be, in the mass,\\nskeptical.  the question thus\\nbecomes: what sort of a notion will\\nhuman society, under the influence\\nof such a state of mind, form of\\nitself?  perhaps the _scientific\\ndemonstration_ of any metaphysical\\nworld is now so difficult that\\nmankind will never be free from a\\ndistrust of it.  and when there is\\nformed a feeling of distrust of\\nmetaphysics, the results are, in the\\nmass, the same as if metaphysics\\nwere refuted altogether and _could_ no\\nlonger be believed.  in both\\ncases the historical question, with regard\\nto an unmetaphysical\\ndisposition in mankind, remains the same.\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n=disbelief in the\\n\"monumentum aere perennius\".=[13]--a decided\\ndisadvantage, attending\\nthe termination of metaphysical modes of\\nthought, is that the\\nindividual fixes his mind too attentively upon his\\nown brief lifetime\\nand feels no strong inducement to aid in the\\nfoundation of\\ninstitutions capable of enduring for centuries: he wishes\\nhimself to\\ngather the fruit from the tree that he plants and\\nconsequently he no\\nlonger plants those trees which require centuries of\\nconstant\\ncultivation and are destined to afford shade to generation\\nafter\\ngeneration in the future.  for metaphysical views inspire the\\nbelief\\nthat in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon which\\nhenceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up: the\\nindividual promotes his own salvation; when, for example, he builds a\\nchurch or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something for\\nthe salvation of his immortal soul:--can science, as well, inspire\\nsuch\\nfaith in the efficacy of her results?  in actual fact, science\\nrequires\\ndoubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries; nevertheless,\\nthe sum of\\nthe irresistible (that is all the onslaughts of skepticism,\\nall the\\ndisintegrating effects of surviving truths) can easily become\\nso great\\n(as, for instance, in the case of hygienic science) as to\\ninspire the\\ndetermination to build \"eternal\" works upon it.  at\\npresent the contrast\\nbetween our excitated ephemeral existence and the\\ntranquil repose of\\nmetaphysical epochs is too great because both are\\nas yet in too close\\njuxtaposition.  the individual man himself now\\ngoes through too many\\nstages of inner and outer evolution for him to\\nventure to make a plan\\neven for his life time alone.  a perfectly\\nmodern man, indeed, who wants\\nto build himself a house feels as if he\\nwere walling himself up alive in\\na mausoleum.\\n\\n[13] monument more\\nenduring than brass: horace, odes iii:xxx.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n=age of\\ncomparison.=--the less men are bound by tradition, the greater\\nis the\\ninner activity of motives, the greater, correspondingly, the\\nouter\\nrestlessness, the promiscuous flow of humanity, the polyphony of\\nstrivings.  who now feels any great impulse to establish himself and\\nhis\\nposterity in a particular place?  for whom, moreover, does there\\nexist,\\nat present, any strong tie?  as all the methods of the arts\\nwere copied\\nfrom one another, so were all the methods and advancements\\nof moral\\ncodes, of manners, of civilizations.--such an age derives its\\nsignificance from the fact that in it the various ideas, codes,\\nmanners\\nand civilizations can be compared and experienced side by\\nside; which\\nwas impossible at an earlier period in view of the\\nlocalised nature of\\nthe rule of every civilization, corresponding to\\nthe limitation of all\\nartistic effects by time and place.  to-day the\\ngrowth of the aesthetic\\nfeeling is decided, owing to the great number\\nof [artistic] forms which\\noffer themselves for comparison.  the\\nmajority--those that are condemned\\nby the method of comparison--will\\nbe allowed to die out.  in the same way\\nthere is to-day taking place a\\nselection of the forms and customs of the\\nhigher morality which can\\nresult only in the extinction of the vulgar\\nmoralities.  this is the\\nage of comparison!  that is its glory--but also\\nits pain.  let us not,\\nhowever shrink from this pain.  rather would we\\ncomprehend the nature\\nof the task imposed upon us by our age as\\nadequately as we can:\\nposterity will bless us for doing so--a posterity\\nthat knows itself to\\nbe [developed] through and above the narrow, early\\nrace-civilizations\\nas well as the culture-civilization of comparison,\\nbut yet looks\\ngratefully back upon both as venerable monuments of\\nantiquity.\\n\\n\\n24\\n=possibility of progress.=--when a master of the old civilization (den\\nalten cultur) vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe in\\nprogress, he is quite right.  for the old civilization[14] has its\\ngreatness and its advantages behind it, and historic training forces\\none\\nto acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor: only\\nintolerable\\nstupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to\\nperceive this\\nfact.  but men may consciously determine to evolve to a\\nnew civilization\\nwhere formerly they evolved unconsciously and\\naccidentally.  they can now\\ndevise better conditions for the\\nadvancement of mankind, for their\\nnourishment, training and education,\\nthey can administer the earth as an\\neconomic power, and, particularly,\\ncompare the capacities of men and\\nselect them accordingly.  this new,\\nconscious civilization is killing the\\nother which, on the whole, has\\nled but an unreflective animal and plant\\nlife: it is also destroying\\nthe doubt of progress itself--progress is\\npossible.  i mean: it is\\nhasty and almost unreflective to assume that\\nprogress must\\n_necessarily_ take place: but how can it be doubted that\\nprogress is\\npossible?  on the other hand, progress in the sense and along\\nthe\\nlines of the old civilization is not even conceivable.  if romantic\\nfantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims and\\nends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive national\\ncivilizations, the picture presented of progress is always borrowed\\nfrom\\nthe past.  the idea and the image of progress thus formed are\\nquite\\nwithout originality.\\n\\n[14] cultur, culture, civilisation etc.,\\nbut there is no exact english\\nequivalent.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n=private ethics and\\nworld ethics.=--since the extinction of the belief\\nthat a god guides\\nthe general destiny of the world and, notwithstanding\\nall the\\ncontortions and windings of the path of mankind, leads it\\ngloriously\\nforward, men must shape oecumenical, world-embracing ends for\\nthemselves.  the older ethics, namely kant\\'s, required of the\\nindividual\\nsuch a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow.\\nthis evinces\\nmuch simplicity--as if any individual could determine off\\nhand what\\ncourse of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity,\\nand what\\ncourse of conduct is preëminently desirable!  this is a\\ntheory like that\\nof freedom of competition, which takes it for granted\\nthat the general\\nharmony [of things] _must_ prevail of itself in\\naccordance with some\\ninherent law of betterment or amelioration.  it\\nmay be that a later\\ncontemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal\\nthat it is by no means\\ndesirable that all men should regulate their\\nconduct according to the\\nsame principle; it may be best, from the\\nstandpoint of certain ends yet\\nto be attained, that men, during long\\nperiods should regulate their\\nconduct with reference to special, and\\neven, in certain circumstances,\\nevil, objects.  at any rate, if\\nmankind is not to be led astray by such a\\nuniversal rule of conduct,\\nit behooves it to attain a _knowledge of the\\ncondition of culture_\\nthat will serve as a scientific standard of\\ncomparison in connection\\nwith cosmical ends.  herein is comprised the\\ntremendous mission of the\\ngreat spirits of the next century.\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n=reaction as\\nprogress.=--occasionally harsh, powerful, impetuous, yet\\nnevertheless\\nbackward spirits, appear, who try to conjure back some past\\nera in the\\nhistory of mankind: they serve as evidence that the new\\ntendencies\\nwhich they oppose, are not yet potent enough, that there is\\nsomething\\nlacking in them: otherwise they [the tendencies] would better\\nwithstand the effects of this conjuring back process.  thus luther\\'s\\nreformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of\\nthe\\nspirit were still uncertain, lacking in vigor, and immature.\\nscience\\ncould not yet rear her head.  indeed the whole renaissance\\nappears but as\\nan early spring smothered in snow.  but even in the\\npresent century\\nschopenhauer\\'s metaphysic shows that the scientific\\nspirit is not yet\\npowerful enough: for the whole mediaeval christian\\nworld-standpoint\\n(weltbetrachtung) and conception of man (mensch-\\nempfindung)[15] once\\nagain, notwithstanding the slowly wrought\\ndestruction of all christian\\ndogma, celebrated a resurrection in\\nschopenhauer\\'s doctrine.  there is\\nmuch science in his teaching\\nalthough the science does not dominate,\\nbut, instead of it, the old,\\ntrite \"metaphysical necessity.\"  it is one\\nof the greatest and most\\npriceless advantages of schopenhauer\\'s teaching\\nthat by it our\\nfeelings are temporarily forced back to those old human\\nand cosmical\\nstandpoints to which no other path could conduct us so\\neasily.  the\\ngain for history and justice is very great.  i believe that\\nwithout\\nschopenhauer\\'s aid it would be no easy matter for anyone now to\\ndo\\njustice to christianity and its asiatic relatives--a thing impossible\\nas regards the christianity that still survives.  after according this\\ngreat triumph to justice, after we have corrected in so essential a\\nrespect the historical point of view which the age of learning brought\\nwith it, we may begin to bear still farther onward the banner of\\nenlightenment--a banner bearing the three names: petrarch, erasmus,\\nvoltaire.  we have taken a forward step out of reaction.\\n\\n[15]\\nliterally man-feeling or human outlook.\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n=a substitute for\\nreligion.=--it is supposed to be a recommendation for\\nphilosophy to\\nsay of it that it provides the people with a substitute\\nfor religion.\\nand in fact, the training of the intellect does\\nnecessitate the\\nconvenient laying out of the track of thought, since the\\ntransition\\nfrom religion by way of science entails a powerful, perilous\\nleap,--\\nsomething that should be advised against.  with this\\nqualification,\\nthe recommendation referred to is a just one.  at the same\\ntime, it\\nshould be further explained that the needs which religion\\nsatisfies\\nand which science must now satisfy, are not immutable.  even\\nthey can\\nbe diminished and uprooted.  think, for instance, of the\\nchristian\\nsoul-need, the sighs over one\\'s inner corruption, the anxiety\\nregarding salvation--all notions that arise simply out of errors of\\nthe\\nreason and require no satisfaction at all, but annihilation.  a\\nphilosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or else\\nput them aside altogether, for they are acquired, circumscribed needs,\\nbased upon hypotheses which those of science explode.  here, for the\\npurpose of affording the means of transition, for the sake of\\nlightening\\nthe spirit overburdened with feeling, art can be employed\\nto far better\\npurpose, as these hypotheses receive far less support\\nfrom art than from\\na metaphysical philosophy.  then from art it is\\neasier to go over to a\\nreally emancipating philosophical science.\\n\\n\\n28\\n=discredited words.=--away with the disgustingly over-used words\\noptimism and pessimism!  for the occasion for using them grows daily\\nless; only drivelers now find them indispensably necessary.  what\\nearthly\\nreason could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a\\ngod to\\ndefend who _must_ have created the best of all possible worlds,\\nsince he\\nis himself all goodness and perfection?--but what thinking\\nman has now\\nany need for the hypothesis that there is a god?--there is\\nalso no\\noccasion whatever for a pessimistic confession of faith,\\nunless one has\\na personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god,\\nthe theologian or\\nthe theological philosopher, and maintaining the\\ncounter proposition\\nthat evil reigns, that wretchedness is more potent\\nthan joy, that the\\nworld is a piece of botch work, that phenomenon\\n(erscheinung) is but the\\nmanifestation of some evil spirit.  but who\\nbothers his head about the\\ntheologians any more--except the\\ntheologians themselves?  apart from all\\ntheology and its antagonism,\\nit is manifest that the world is neither\\ngood nor bad, (to say nothing\\nabout its being the best or the worst) and\\nthat these ideas of \"good\"\\nand \"bad\" have significance only in relation\\nto men, indeed, are\\nwithout significance at all, in view of the sense in\\nwhich they are\\nusually employed.  the contemptuous and the eulogistic\\npoint of view\\nmust, in every case, be repudiated.\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n=intoxicated by the perfume\\nof flowers.=--the ship of humanity, it is\\nthought, acquires an ever\\ndeeper draught the more it is laden.  it is\\nbelieved that the more\\nprofoundly man thinks, the more exquisitely he\\nfeels, the higher the\\nstandard he sets for himself, the greater his\\ndistance from the other\\nanimals--the more he appears as a genius\\n(genie) among animals--the\\nnearer he gets to the true nature of the\\nworld and to comprehension\\nthereof: this, indeed, he really does through\\nscience, but he thinks\\nhe does it far more adequately through his\\nreligions and arts.  these\\nare, certainly, a blossoming of the world, but\\nnot, therefore, _nearer\\nthe roots of the world_ than is the stalk.  one\\ncannot learn best from\\nit the nature of the world, although nearly\\neveryone thinks so.\\n_error_ has made men so deep, sensitive and\\nimaginative in order to\\nbring forth such flowers as religions and arts.\\npure apprehension\\nwould be unable to do that.  whoever should disclose to\\nus the essence\\nof the world would be undeceiving us most cruelly.  not\\nthe world as\\nthing-in-itself but the world as idea[16] (as error) is\\nrich in\\nportent, deep, wonderful, carrying happiness and unhappiness in\\nits\\nwomb.  this result leads to a philosophy of world negation: which, at\\nany rate, can be as well combined with a practical world affirmation\\nas\\nwith its opposite.\\n\\n[16] vorstellung: this word sometimes\\ncorresponds to the english word\\n\"idea\", at others to \"conception\" or\\n\"notion.\"\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n=evil habits in reaching conclusions.=--the most usual\\nerroneous\\nconclusions of men are these: a thing[17] exists, therefore\\nit is right:\\nhere from capacity to live is deduced fitness, from\\nfitness, is deduced\\njustification.  so also: an opinion gives\\nhappiness, therefore it is the\\ntrue one, its effect is good, therefore\\nit is itself good and true.  here\\nis predicated of the effect that it\\ngives happiness, that it is good in\\nthe sense of utility, and there is\\nlikewise predicated of the cause that\\nit is good, but good in the\\nsense of logical validity.  conversely, the\\nproposition would run: a\\nthing[17] cannot attain success, cannot\\nmaintain itself, therefore it\\nis evil: a belief troubles [the believer],\\noccasions pain, therefore\\nit is false.  the free spirit, who is sensible\\nof the defect in this\\nmethod of reaching conclusions and has had to\\nsuffer its consequences,\\noften succumbs to the temptation to come to the\\nvery opposite\\nconclusions (which, in general, are, of course, equally\\nerroneous): a\\nthing cannot maintain itself: therefore it is good; a\\nbelief is\\ntroublesome, therefore it is true.\\n\\n[17] sache, thing but not in the\\nsense of ding.  sache is of very\\nindefinite application (res).\\n\\n\\n31\\n=the illogical is necessary.=--among the things which can bring a\\nthinker to distraction is the knowledge that the illogical is\\nnecessary\\nto mankind and that from the illogical springs much that is\\ngood.  the\\nillogical is so imbedded in the passions, in language, in\\nart, in\\nreligion and, above all, in everything that imparts value to\\nlife that\\nit cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those\\nbeautiful\\nthings.  only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that\\nthe nature\\nman knows can be changed into a purely logical nature.  yet\\nwere there\\nsteps affording approach to this goal, how utterly\\neverything would be\\nlost on the way!  even the most rational man needs\\nnature again, from\\ntime to time, that is, his illogical fundamental\\nrelation\\n(grundstellung) to all things.\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\n=being unjust is\\nessential.=--all judgments of the value of life are\\nillogically\\ndeveloped and therefore unjust.  the vice of the judgment\\nconsists,\\nfirst, in the way in which the subject matter comes under\\nobservation,\\nthat is, very incompletely; secondly in the way in which\\nthe total is\\nsummed up; and, thirdly, in the fact that each single item\\nin the\\ntotality of the subject matter is itself the result of defective\\nperception, and this from absolute necessity.  no practical knowledge\\nof\\na man, for example, stood he never so near to us, can be complete--\\nso\\nthat we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him;\\nall\\nestimates are summary and must be so.  then the standard by which\\nwe\\nmeasure, (our being) is not an immutable quantity; we have moods\\nand\\nvariations, and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable\\nstandard\\nbefore we undertake to establish the nature of the relation\\nof any thing\\n(sache) to ourselves.  perhaps it will follow from all\\nthis that one\\nshould form no judgments whatever; if one could but\\nmerely _live_\\nwithout having to form estimates, without aversion and\\nwithout\\npartiality!--for everything most abhorred is closely connected\\nwith an\\nestimate, as well as every strongest partiality.  an\\ninclination towards\\na thing, or from a thing, without an accompanying\\nfeeling that the\\nbeneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned,\\nan inclination\\nwithout a sort of experiential estimation of the\\ndesirability of an end,\\ndoes not exist in man.  we are primordially\\nillogical and hence unjust\\nbeings _and can recognise this fact_: this\\nis one of the greatest and\\nmost baffling discords of existence.\\n\\n\\n33\\n=error respecting living for the sake of living essential.=--every\\nbelief in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defective\\nthinking; it is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with the\\ngeneral life and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in\\nthe\\nindividual.  even exceptional men, who can think beyond their own\\npersonalities, do not have this general life in view, but isolated\\nportions of it.  if one is capable of fixing his observation upon\\nexceptional cases, i mean upon highly endowed individuals and pure\\nsouled beings, if their development is taken as the true end of\\nworld-\\nevolution and if joy be felt in their existence, then it is\\npossible\\nto believe in the value of life, because in that case the rest\\nof\\nhumanity is overlooked: hence we have here defective thinking.  so,\\ntoo, it is even if all mankind be taken into consideration, and one\\nspecies only of impulses (the less egoistic) brought under review and\\nthose, in consideration of the other impulses, exalted: then something\\ncould still be hoped of mankind in the mass and to that extent there\\ncould exist belief in the value of life: here, again, as a result of\\ndefective thinking.  whatever attitude, thus, one may assume, one is,\\nas\\na result of this attitude, an exception among mankind.  now, the\\ngreat\\nmajority of mankind endure life without any great protest, and\\nbelieve,\\nto this extent, in the value of existence, but that is\\nbecause each\\nindividual decides and determines alone, and never comes\\nout of his own\\npersonality like these exceptions: everything outside\\nof the personal\\nhas no existence for them or at the utmost is observed\\nas but a faint\\nshadow.  consequently the value of life for the\\ngenerality of mankind\\nconsists simply in the fact that the individual\\nattaches more importance\\nto himself than he does to the world.  the\\ngreat lack of imagination from\\nwhich he suffers is responsible for his\\ninability to enter into the\\nfeelings of beings other than himself, and\\nhence his sympathy with their\\nfate and suffering is of the slightest\\npossible description.  on the\\nother hand, whosoever really _could_\\nsympathise, necessarily doubts the\\nvalue of life; were it possible for\\nhim to sum up and to feel in himself\\nthe total consciousness of\\nmankind, he would collapse with a malediction\\nagainst existence,--for\\nmankind is, in the mass, without a goal, and\\nhence man cannot find, in\\nthe contemplation of his whole course,\\nanything to serve him as a\\nmainstay and a comfort, but rather a reason\\nto despair.  if he looks\\nbeyond the things that immediately engage him to\\nthe final aimlessness\\nof humanity, his own conduct assumes in his eyes\\nthe character of a\\nfrittering away.  to feel oneself, however, as\\nhumanity (not alone as\\nan individual) frittered away exactly as we see\\nthe stray leaves\\nfrittered away by nature, is a feeling transcending all\\nfeeling.  but\\nwho is capable of it?  only a poet, certainly: and poets\\nalways know\\nhow to console themselves.\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n=for tranquility.=--but will not our\\nphilosophy become thus a tragedy?\\nwill not truth prove the enemy of\\nlife, of betterment?  a question seems\\nto weigh upon our tongue and\\nyet will not put itself into words: whether\\none _can_ knowingly remain\\nin the domain of the untruthful?  or, if one\\n_must_, whether, then,\\ndeath would not be preferable?  for there is no\\nlonger any ought\\n(sollen), morality; so far as it is involved \"ought,\"\\nis, through our\\npoint of view, as utterly annihilated as religion.  our\\nknowledge can\\npermit only pleasure and pain, benefit and injury, to\\nsubsist as\\nmotives.  but how can these motives be distinguished from the\\ndesire\\nfor truth?  even they rest upon error (in so far, as already\\nstated,\\npartiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimates\\npalpably\\nmodify our pleasure and our pain). the whole of human life is\\ndeeply\\ninvolved in _untruth_. the individual cannot extricate it from\\nthis\\npit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole past,\\nwithout finding his present motives of conduct, (as that of honor)\\nillegitimate, and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitions\\nwhich prompt one to have regard for the future and for one\\'s happiness\\nin the future.  is it true, does there, then, remain but one way of\\nthinking, which, as a personal consequence brings in its train\\ndespair,\\nand as a theoretical [consequence brings in its train] a\\nphilosophy of\\ndecay, disintegration, self annihilation?  i believe the\\ndeciding\\ninfluence, as regards the after-effect of knowledge, will be\\nthe\\n_temperament_ of a man; i can, in addition to this after-effect\\njust\\nmentioned, suppose another, by means of which a much simpler\\nlife, and\\none freer from disturbances than the present, could be\\nlived; so that at\\nfirst the old motives of vehement passion might\\nstill have strength,\\nowing to hereditary habit, but they would\\ngradually grow weaker under\\nthe influence of purifying knowledge.  a\\nman would live, at last, both\\namong men and unto himself, as in the\\nnatural state, without praise,\\nreproach, competition, feasting one\\'s\\neyes, as if it were a play, upon\\nmuch that formerly inspired dread.\\none would be rid of the strenuous\\nelement, and would no longer feel\\nthe goad of the reflection that man is\\nnot even [as much as] nature,\\nnor more than nature.  to be sure, this\\nrequires, as already stated, a\\ngood temperament, a fortified, gentle and\\nnaturally cheerful soul, a\\ndisposition that has no need to be on its\\nguard against its own\\neccentricities and sudden outbreaks and that in\\nits utterances\\nmanifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tone--those\\nfamiliar,\\ndisagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that have\\nbeen a\\nlong time chained up.  rather must a man, from whom the ordinary\\nbondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent, so do that he\\nonly lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge, and to learn\\nto\\nresign, without envy and without disappointment, much, yes nearly\\neverything, that has value in the eyes of men.  he must be content\\nwith\\nsuch a free, fearless soaring above men, manners, laws and\\ntraditional\\nestimates of things, as the most desirable of all\\nsituations.  he will\\nfreely share the joy of being in such a\\nsituation, and he has, perhaps,\\nnothing else to share--in which\\nrenunciation and self-denial really most\\nconsist.  but if more is\\nasked of him, he will, with a benevolent shake\\nof the head, refer to\\nhis brother, the free man of fact, and will,\\nperhaps, not dissemble a\\nlittle contempt: for, as regards his \"freedom,\"\\nthereby hangs a\\ntale.[18]\\n\\n[18] den mit dessen \"freiheit\" hat es eine eigene\\nbewandtniss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhistory of the moral feelings.\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n=advantages of\\npsychological observation.=--that reflection regarding\\nthe human, all-\\ntoo-human--or as the learned jargon is: psychological\\nobservation--is\\namong the means whereby the burden of life can be made\\nlighter, that\\npractice in this art affords presence of mind in difficult\\nsituations\\nand entertainment amid a wearisome environment, aye, that\\nmaxims may\\nbe culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of life\\nand\\ninvigoration thereby obtained: this much was believed, was known--in\\nformer centuries.  why was this forgotten in our own century, during\\nwhich, at least in germany, yes in europe, poverty as regards\\npsychological observation would have been manifest in many ways had\\nthere been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself.\\nnot\\nonly in the novel, in the romance, in philosophical standpoints--\\nthese\\nare the works of exceptional men; still more in the state of\\nopinion\\nregarding public events and personages; above all in general\\nsociety,\\nwhich says much about men but nothing whatever about man,\\nthere is\\ntotally lacking the art of psychological analysis and\\nsynthesis.  but why\\nis the richest and most harmless source of\\nentertainment thus allowed to\\nrun to waste?  why is the greatest\\nmaster of the psychological maxim no\\nlonger read?--for, with no\\nexaggeration whatever be it said: the\\neducated person in europe who\\nhas read la rochefoucauld and his\\nintellectual and artistic affinities\\nis very hard to find; still harder,\\nthe person who knows them and does\\nnot disparage them.  apparently, too,\\nthis unusual reader takes far\\nless pleasure in them than the form\\nadopted by these artists should\\nafford him: for the subtlest mind cannot\\nadequately appreciate the art\\nof maxim-making unless it has had training\\nin it, unless it has\\ncompeted in it.  without such practical\\nacquaintance, one is apt to\\nlook upon this making and forming as a much\\neasier thing than it\\nreally is; one is not keenly enough alive to the\\nfelicity and the\\ncharm of success.  hence present day readers of maxims\\nhave but a\\nmoderate, tempered pleasure in them, scarcely, indeed, a true\\nperception of their merit, so that their experiences are about the\\nsame\\nas those of the average beholder of cameos: people who praise\\nbecause\\nthey cannot appreciate, and are very ready to admire and still\\nreadier\\nto turn away.\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n=objection.=--or is there a counter-\\nproposition to the dictum that\\npsychological observation is one of the\\nmeans of consoling, lightening,\\ncharming existence?  have enough of\\nthe unpleasant effects of this art\\nbeen experienced to justify the\\nperson striving for culture in turning\\nhis regard away from it?  in\\nall truth, a certain blind faith in the\\ngoodness of human nature, an\\nimplanted distaste for any disparagement of\\nhuman concerns, a sort of\\nshamefacedness at the nakedness of the soul,\\nmay be far more desirable\\nthings in the general happiness of a man, than\\nthis only occasionally\\nadvantageous quality of psychological\\nsharpsightedness; and perhaps\\nbelief in the good, in virtuous men and\\nactions, in a plenitude of\\ndisinterested benevolence has been more\\nproductive of good in the\\nworld of men in so far as it has made men less\\ndistrustful.  if\\nplutarch\\'s heroes are enthusiastically imitated and a\\nreluctance is\\nexperienced to looking too critically into the motives of\\ntheir\\nactions, not the knowledge but the welfare of human society is\\npromoted thereby: psychological error and above all obtuseness in\\nregard\\nto it, help human nature forward, whereas knowledge of the\\ntruth is more\\npromoted by means of the stimulating strength of a\\nhypothesis; as la\\nrochefoucauld in the first edition of his \"sentences\\nand moral maxims\"\\nhas expressed it: \"what the world calls virtue is\\nordinarily but a\\nphantom created by the passions, and to which we give\\na good name in\\norder to do whatever we please with impunity.\"  la\\nrochefoucauld and\\nthose other french masters of soul-searching (to the\\nnumber of whom has\\nlately been added a german, the author of\\n\"psychological observations\")\\nare like expert marksmen who again and\\nagain hit the black spot--but it\\nis the black spot in human nature.\\ntheir art inspires amazement, but\\nfinally some spectator, inspired,\\nnot by the scientific spirit but by a\\nhumanitarian feeling, execrates\\nan art that seems to implant in the soul\\na taste for belittling and\\nimpeaching mankind.\\n\\n\\n37\\n\\n=nevertheless.=--the matter therefore, as\\nregards pro and con, stands\\nthus: in the present state of philosophy\\nan awakening of the moral\\nobservation is essential.  the repulsive\\naspect of psychological\\ndissection, with the knife and tweezers\\nentailed by the process, can no\\nlonger be spared humanity.  such is\\nthe imperative duty of any science\\nthat investigates the origin and\\nhistory of the so-called moral feelings\\nand which, in its progress, is\\ncalled upon to posit and to solve\\nadvanced social problems:--the older\\nphilosophy does not recognize the\\nnewer at all and, through paltry\\nevasions, has always gone astray in the\\ninvestigation of the origin\\nand history of human estimates\\n(werthschätzungen). with what results\\nmay now be very clearly perceived,\\nsince it has been shown by many\\nexamples, how the errors of the greatest\\nphilosophers have their\\norigin in a false explanation of certain human\\nactions and feelings;\\nhow upon the foundation of an erroneous analysis\\n(for example, of the\\nso called disinterested actions), a false ethic is\\nreared, to support\\nwhich religion and like mythological monstrosities\\nare called in,\\nuntil finally the shades of these troubled spirits\\ncollapse in physics\\nand in the comprehensive world point of view.  but if\\nit be\\nestablished that superficiality of psychological observation has\\nheretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment and\\ndeduction, and will continue to do so, all the greater need is there\\nof\\nthat steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone\\nupon\\nstone, little stone upon little stone; all the greater need is\\nthere of\\na courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that\\nwill oppose\\npersistence, to all contempt.  it is, finally, also true\\nthat countless\\nsingle observations concerning the human, all-too-\\nhuman, have been\\nfirst made and uttered in circles accustomed, not to\\nfurnish matter for\\nscientific knowledge, but for intellectual\\npleasure-seeking; and the\\noriginal home atmosphere--a very seductive\\natmosphere--of the moral\\nmaxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated\\nthe entire species, so\\nthat the scientific man involuntarily manifests\\na sort of mistrust of\\nthis species and of its seriousness.  but it is\\nsufficient to point to\\nthe consequences: for already it is becoming\\nevident that events of the\\nmost portentous nature are developing in\\nthe domain of psychological\\nobservation.  what is the leading\\nconclusion arrived at by one of the\\nsubtlest and calmest of thinkers,\\nthe author of the work \"concerning the\\norigin of the moral feelings\",\\nas a result of his thorough and incisive\\nanalysis of human conduct?\\n\"the moral man,\" he says, \"stands no nearer\\nthe knowable\\n(metaphysical) world than the physical man.\"[19] this\\ndictum, grown\\nhard and cutting beneath the hammer-blow of historical\\nknowledge, can\\nsome day, perhaps, in some future or other, serve as the\\naxe that will\\nbe laid to the root of the \"metaphysical necessities\" of\\nmen--whether\\nmore to the blessing than to the banning of universal well\\nbeing who\\ncan say?--but in any event a dictum fraught with the most\\nmomentous\\nconsequences, fruitful and fearful at once, and confronting\\nthe world\\nin the two faced way characteristic of all great facts.\\n\\n[19] \"der\\nmoralische mensch, sagt er, steht der intelligiblen\\n(metaphysischen)\\nwelt nicht näher, als der physische mensch.\"\\n\\n\\n38\\n\\n=to what extent\\nuseful.=--therefore, whether psychological observation\\nis more an\\nadvantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remain\\nundetermined: but there is no doubt that it is necessary, because\\nscience can no longer dispense with it.  science, however, recognizes\\nno\\nconsiderations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does;\\nbut\\nas the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for\\ncertain\\nends without any intention of doing it, so will true science,\\ndoing with\\nideas what nature does with matter,[20] promote the\\npurposes and the\\nwelfare of humanity, (as occasion may afford, and in\\nmany ways) and\\nattain fitness [to ends]--but likewise without having\\nintended it.\\n\\n[20] als die nachahmung der natur in begriffen,\\nliterally: \"as the\\ncounterfeit of nature in (regard to) ideas.\"\\n\\nhe to\\nwhom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintry,\\nhas\\ntoo little fire in him: let him look about him, and he will become\\nsensible of maladies requiring an icy air, and of people who are so\\n\"kneaded together\" out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcely\\nfind anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them.  moreover:\\nas\\ntoo serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivial\\nrelaxations; as others, too volatile and excitable require onerous,\\nweighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy: should not we, the\\nmore\\nintellectual men of this age, which is swept more and more by\\nconflagrations, catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance we\\ncan find that we may always remain as self contained, steady and calm\\nas\\nwe are now, and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and\\nself\\nreflector, when the occasion arises?\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n=the fable of\\ndiscretionary freedom.=--the history of the feelings, on\\nthe basis of\\nwhich we make everyone responsible, hence, the so-called\\nmoral\\nfeelings, is traceable in the following leading phases.  at first\\nsingle actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their\\nmotive, but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial\\nconsequences they have for the community.  in time, however, the\\norigin\\nof these designations is forgotten [but] it is imagined that\\naction in\\nitself, without reference to its consequences, contains the\\nproperty\\n\"good\" or \"bad\": with the same error according to which\\nlanguage\\ndesignates the stone itself as hard[ness] the tree itself as\\ngreen[ness]--for the reason, therefore, that what is a consequence is\\ncomprehended as a cause.  accordingly, the good[ness] or bad[ness] is\\nincorporated into the motive and [any] deed by itself is regarded as\\nmorally ambiguous.  a step further is taken, and the predication good\\nor\\nbad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire\\nnature\\nof a man, out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of\\nthe soil.\\nthus man is successively made responsible for his\\n[particular] acts,\\nthen for his [course of] conduct, then for his\\nmotives and finally for\\nhis nature.  now, at last, is it discovered\\nthat this nature, even,\\ncannot be responsible, inasmuch as it is only\\nand wholly a necessary\\nconsequence and is synthesised out of the\\nelements and influence of past\\nand present things: therefore, that man\\nis to be made responsible for\\nnothing, neither for his nature, nor his\\nmotives, nor his [course of]\\nconduct nor his [particular] acts.  by\\nthis [process] is gained the\\nknowledge that the history of moral\\nestimates is the history of error,\\nof the error of responsibility: as\\nis whatever rests upon the error of\\nthe freedom of the will.\\nschopenhauer concluded just the other way,\\nthus: since certain actions\\nbring depression (\"consciousness of guilt\")\\nin their train, there\\nmust, then, exist responsibility, for there would\\nbe no basis for this\\ndepression at hand if all man\\'s affairs did not\\nfollow their course of\\nnecessity--as they do, indeed, according to the\\nopinion of this\\nphilosopher, follow their course--but man himself,\\nsubject to the same\\nnecessity, would be just the man that he is--which\\nschopenhauer\\ndenies.  from the fact of such depression schopenhauer\\nbelieves\\nhimself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have\\nhad,\\nnot indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature:\\nfreedom, therefore, to be thus and so, not to act thus and so.  out of\\nthe _esse_, the sphere of freedom and responsibility, follows,\\naccording\\nto his opinion, the _operari_, the spheres of invariable\\ncausation,\\nnecessity and irresponsibility.  this depression, indeed,\\nis due\\napparently to the _operari_--in so far as it be delusive--but\\nin truth\\nto whatever _esse_ be the deed of a free will, the basic\\ncause of the\\nexistence of an individual: [in order to] let man become\\nwhatever he\\nwills to become, his [to] will (wollen) must precede his\\nexistence.--here, apart from the absurdity of the statement just made,\\nthere is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depression\\nexplains its character, the rational admissibility of it: from such a\\nwrong inference does schopenhauer first come to his fantastic\\nconsequent\\nof the so called discretionary freedom (intelligibeln\\nfreiheit). (for\\nthe origin of this fabulous entity plato and kant are\\nequally\\nresponsible). but depression after the act does not need to be\\nrational:\\nindeed, it is certainly not so at all, for it rests upon the\\nerroneous\\nassumption that the act need not necessarily have come to\\npass.\\ntherefore: only because man deems himself free, but not because\\nhe is free, does he experience remorse and the stings of\\nconscience.--\\nmoreover, this depression is something that can be grown\\nout of; in\\nmany men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts\\nwhich\\ninspire it in many other men.  it is a very varying thing and one\\nclosely connected with the development of custom and civilization, and\\nperhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the world\\'s\\nhistory.--no one is responsible for his acts, no one for his nature;\\nto\\njudge is tantamount to being unjust.  this applies as well when the\\nindividual judges himself.  the proposition is as clear as sunlight,\\nand\\nyet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for\\nfear\\nof the consequences.\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n=above animal.=--the beast in us must\\nbe wheedled: ethic is necessary,\\nthat we may not be torn to pieces.\\nwithout the errors involved in the\\nassumptions of ethics, man would\\nhave remained an animal.  thus has he\\ntaken himself as something\\nhigher and imposed rigid laws upon himself.\\nhe feels hatred,\\nconsequently, for states approximating the animal:\\nwhence the former\\ncontempt for the slave as a not-yet-man, as a thing,\\nis to be\\nexplained.\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n=unalterable character.=--that character is\\nunalterable is not, in the\\nstrict sense, true; rather is this favorite\\nproposition valid only to\\nthe extent that during the brief life period\\nof a man the potent new\\nmotives can not, usually, press down hard\\nenough to obliterate the lines\\nimprinted by ages.  could we conceive\\nof a man eighty thousand years old,\\nwe should have in him an\\nabsolutely alterable character; so that the\\nmaturities of successive,\\nvarying individuals would develop in him.  the\\nshortness of human life\\nleads to many erroneous assertions concerning\\nthe qualities of man.\\n42\\n\\n=classification of enjoyments and ethic.=--the once accepted\\ncomparative\\nclassification of enjoyments, according to which an\\ninferior, higher,\\nhighest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment,\\nnow decides as to\\nethical status or unethical status.  a lower\\nenjoyment (for example,\\nsensual pleasure) preferred to a more highly\\nesteemed one (for example,\\nhealth) rates as unethical, as does welfare\\npreferred to freedom.  the\\ncomparative classification of enjoyments is\\nnot, however, alike or the\\nsame at all periods; when anyone demands\\nsatisfaction of the law, he is,\\nfrom the point of view of an earlier\\ncivilization, moral, from that of\\nthe present, non-moral.  \"unethical\"\\nindicates, therefore, that a man is\\nnot sufficiently sensible to the\\nhigher, finer impulses which the\\npresent civilization has brought with\\nit, or is not sensible to them at\\nall; it indicates backwardness, but\\nonly from the point of view of the\\ncontemporary degree of distinction.\\n--the comparative classification of\\nenjoyments itself is not\\ndetermined according to absolute ethics; but\\nafter each new ethical\\nadjustment, it is then decided whether conduct be\\nethical or the\\nreverse.\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n=inhuman men as survivals.=--men who are now inhuman\\nmust serve us as\\nsurviving specimens of earlier civilizations.  the\\nmountain height of\\nhumanity here reveals its lower formations, which\\nmight otherwise remain\\nhidden from view.  there are surviving\\nspecimens of humanity whose brains\\nthrough the vicissitudes of\\nheredity, have escaped proper development.\\nthey show us what we all\\nwere and thus appal us; but they are as little\\nresponsible on this\\naccount as is a piece of granite for being granite.\\nin our own brains\\nthere must be courses and windings corresponding to\\nsuch characters,\\njust as in the forms of some human organs there survive\\ntraces of\\nfishhood.  but these courses and windings are no longer the bed\\nin\\nwhich flows the stream of our feeling.\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n=gratitude and\\nrevenge.=--the reason the powerful man is grateful is\\nthis.  his\\nbenefactor has, through his benefaction, invaded the domain of\\nthe\\npowerful man and established himself on an equal footing: the\\npowerful\\nman in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and gets\\nsatisfaction\\nthrough the act of gratitude.  it is a mild form of revenge.\\nby not\\nobtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would have\\nshown\\nhimself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward.  hence\\nevery\\nsociety of the good, that is to say, of the powerful originally,\\nplaces gratitude among the first of duties.--swift has added the\\ndictum\\nthat man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful.\\n45\\n\\n=two-fold historical origin of good and evil.=--the notion of good\\nand\\nbad has a two-fold historical origin: namely, first, in the spirit\\nof\\nruling races and castes.  whoever has power to requite good with\\ngood and\\nevil with evil and actually brings requital, (that is, is\\ngrateful and\\nrevengeful) acquires the name of being good; whoever is\\npowerless and\\ncannot requite is called bad.  a man belongs, as a good\\nindividual, to\\nthe \"good\" of a community, who have a feeling in\\ncommon, because all the\\nindividuals are allied with one another\\nthrough the requiting sentiment.\\na man belongs, as a bad individual,\\nto the \"bad,\" to a mass of\\nsubjugated, powerless men who have no\\nfeeling in common.  the good are a\\ncaste, the bad are a quantity, like\\ndust.  good and bad is, for a\\nconsiderable period, tantamount to noble\\nand servile, master and slave.\\non the other hand an enemy is not\\nlooked upon as bad: he can requite.\\nthe trojan and the greek are in\\nhomer both good.  not he, who does no\\nharm, but he who is despised, is\\ndeemed bad.  in the community of the\\ngood individuals [the quality of]\\ngood[ness] is inherited; it is\\nimpossible for a bad individual to grow\\nfrom such a rich soil.  if,\\nnotwithstanding, one of the good\\nindividuals does something unworthy of\\nhis goodness, recourse is had\\nto exorcism; thus the guilt is ascribed to\\na deity, the while it is\\ndeclared that this deity bewitched the good man\\ninto madness and\\nblindness.--second, in the spirit of the subjugated,\\nthe powerless.\\nhere every other man is, to the individual, hostile,\\ninconsiderate,\\ngreedy, inhuman, avaricious, be he noble or servile; bad\\nis the\\ncharacteristic term for man, for every living being, indeed, that\\nis\\nrecognized at all, even for a god: human, divine, these notions are\\ntantamount to devilish, bad.  manifestations of goodness, sympathy,\\nhelpfulness, are regarded with anxiety as trickiness, preludes to an\\nevil end, deception, subtlety, in short, as refined badness.  with\\nsuch a\\npredisposition in individuals, a feeling in common can scarcely\\narise at\\nall, at most only the rudest form of it: so that everywhere\\nthat this\\nconception of good and evil prevails, the destruction of the\\nindividuals, their race and nation, is imminent.--our existing\\nmorality\\nhas developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and\\ncastes.\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n=sympathy greater than suffering.=--there are\\ncircumstances in which\\nsympathy is stronger than the suffering itself.\\nwe feel more pain, for\\ninstance, when one of our friends becomes\\nguilty of a reprehensible\\naction than if we had done the deed\\nourselves.  we once, that is, had\\nmore faith in the purity of his\\ncharacter than he had himself.  hence our\\nlove for him, (apparently\\nbecause of this very faith) is stronger than\\nis his own love for\\nhimself.  if, indeed, his egoism really suffers more,\\nas a result,\\nthan our egoism, inasmuch as he must take the consequences\\nof his\\nfault to a greater extent than ourselves, nevertheless, the\\nunegoistic\\n--this word is not to be taken too strictly, but simply as a\\nmodified\\nform of expression--in us is more affected by his guilt than\\nthe\\nunegoistic in him.\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\n=hypochondria.=--there are people who, from\\nsympathy and anxiety for\\nothers become hypochondriacal.  the resulting\\nform of compassion is\\nnothing else than sickness.  so, also, is there\\na christian hypochondria,\\nfrom which those singular, religiously\\nagitated people suffer who place\\nalways before their eyes the\\nsuffering and death of christ.\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\n=economy of blessings.=--the\\nadvantageous and the pleasing, as the\\nhealthiest growths and powers in\\nthe intercourse of men, are such\\nprecious treasures that it is much to\\nbe wished the use made of these\\nbalsamic means were as economical as\\npossible: but this is impossible.\\neconomy in the use of blessings is\\nthe dream of the craziest of\\nutopians.\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n=well-wishing.=--among\\nthe small, but infinitely plentiful and therefore\\nvery potent things\\nto which science must pay more attention than to the\\ngreat, uncommon\\nthings, well-wishing[21] must be reckoned; i mean those\\nmanifestations\\nof friendly disposition in intercourse, that laughter of\\nthe eye,\\nevery hand pressure, every courtesy from which, in general,\\nevery\\nhuman act gets its quality.  every teacher, every functionary adds\\nthis element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty; it is the\\nperpetual well spring of humanity, like the waves of light in which\\neverything grows; thus, in the narrowest circles, within the family,\\nlife blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling.  the\\ncheerfulness, friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailing\\nsources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilization\\nthan those other more noised manifestations of it that are styled\\nsympathy, benevolence and sacrifice.  but it is customary to\\ndepreciate\\nthese little tokens of kindly feeling, and, indeed, there\\nis not much of\\nthe unegoistic in them.  the sum of these little doses\\nis very great,\\nnevertheless; their combined strength is of the\\ngreatest of\\nstrengths.--thus, too, much more happiness is to be found\\nin the world\\nthan gloomy eyes discover: that is, if the calculation be\\njust, and all\\nthese pleasing moments in which every day, even the\\nmeanest human life,\\nis rich, be not forgotten.\\n\\n[21] wohl-wollen, kind\\nfeeling.  it stands here for benevolence but not\\nbenevolence in the\\nrestricted sense of the word now prevailing.\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n=the desire to\\ninspire compassion.=--la rochefoucauld, in the most\\nnotable part of\\nhis self portraiture (first printed 1658) reaches the\\nvital spot of\\ntruth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on\\ntheir guard\\nagainst compassion, when he advises that this sentiment be\\nleft to men\\nof the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the\\nemotions\\n(since they are not guided by reason) to induce them to give\\naid to\\nthe suffering and to be of service in misfortune: whereas\\ncompassion,\\nin his (and plato\\'s) view, deprives the heart of strength.\\nto be sure,\\nsympathy should be manifested but men should take care not\\nto feel it;\\nfor the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the\\nmanifestation of\\nsympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the\\nworld.--perhaps a\\nmore effectual warning against this compassion can be\\ngiven if this\\nneed of the unfortunate be considered not simply as\\nstupidity and\\nintellectual weakness, not as a sort of distraction of the\\nspirit\\nentailed by misfortune itself (and thus, indeed, does la\\nrochefoucauld\\nseem to view it) but as something quite different and more\\nmomentous.\\nlet note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to\\nbe\\ncompassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their\\ncondition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and the\\noppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing,\\nthe\\nposturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the\\ncausing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholder\\nmanifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much\\nas\\nthey are made to perceive that at least they have the power,\\nnotwithstanding all their weakness, to inflict pain.  the unfortunate\\nexperiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which the\\nmanifestation of sympathy entails; his imagination is exalted; he is\\nalways strong enough, then, to cause the world pain.  thus is the\\nthirst\\nfor sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of\\none\\'s\\nfellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his\\nown dear\\nself: not in his mere \"dullness\" as la rochefoucauld thinks.\\n--in social\\nconversation three fourths of all the questions are asked,\\nand three\\nfourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some\\nlittle\\npain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it\\ngives them\\na sense of their power.  in these countless but very small\\ndoses in which\\nthe quality of badness is administered it proves a\\npotent stimulant of\\nlife: to the same extent that well wishing--(wohl-\\nwollen) distributed\\nthrough the world in like manner, is one of the\\never ready\\nrestoratives.--but will many honorable people be found to\\nadmit that\\nthere is any pleasure in administering pain?  that\\nentertainment--and\\nrare entertainment--is not seldom found in causing\\nothers, at least in\\nthought, some pain, and in raking them with the\\nsmall shot of\\nwickedness?  the majority are too ignoble and a few are\\ntoo good to know\\nanything of this pudendum: the latter may,\\nconsequently, be prompt to\\ndeny that prosper mérimée is right when he\\nsays: \"know, also, that\\nnothing is more common than to do wrong for\\nthe pleasure of doing it.\"\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n=how appearance becomes\\nreality.=--the actor cannot, at last, refrain,\\neven in moments of the\\ndeepest pain, from thinking of the effect\\nproduced by his deportment\\nand by his surroundings--for example, even at\\nthe funeral of his own\\nchild: he will weep at his own sorrow and its\\nmanifestations as though\\nhe were his own audience.  the hypocrite who\\nalways plays one and the\\nsame part, finally ceases to be a hypocrite; as\\nin the case of priests\\nwho, when young men, are always, either\\nconsciously or unconsciously,\\nhypocrites, and finally become naturally\\nand then really, without\\naffectation, mere priests: or if the father\\ndoes not carry it to this\\nextent, the son, who inherits his father\\'s\\ncalling and gets the\\nadvantage of the paternal progress, does.  when\\nanyone, during a long\\nperiod, and persistently, wishes to appear\\nsomething, it will at last\\nprove difficult for him to be anything else.\\nthe calling of almost\\nevery man, even of the artist, begins with\\nhypocrisy, with an\\nimitation of deportment, with a copying of the\\neffective in manner.\\nhe who always wears the mask of a friendly man must\\nat last gain a\\npower over friendliness of disposition, without which the\\nexpression\\nitself of friendliness is not to be gained--and finally\\nfriendliness\\nof disposition gains the ascendancy over him--he _is_\\nbenevolent.\\n\\n\\n52\\n=the point of honor in deception.=--in all great deceivers one\\ncharacteristic is prominent, to which they owe their power.  in the\\nvery\\nact of deception, amid all the accompaniments, the agitation in\\nthe\\nvoice, the expression, the bearing, in the crisis of the scene,\\nthere\\ncomes over them a belief in themselves; this it is that acts so\\neffectively and irresistibly upon the beholders.  founders of\\nreligions\\ndiffer from such great deceivers in that they never come out\\nof this\\nstate of self deception, or else they have, very rarely, a few\\nmoments\\nof enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt;\\ngenerally,\\nhowever, they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments\\nof\\nenlightenment to the evil adversary.  self deception must exist\\nthat both\\nclasses of deceivers may attain far reaching results.  for\\nmen believe in\\nthe truth of all that is manifestly believed with due\\nimplicitness by\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n53\\n\\n=presumed degrees of truth.=--one of the\\nmost usual errors of deduction\\nis: because someone truly and openly is\\nagainst us, therefore he speaks\\nthe truth.  hence the child has faith\\nin the judgments of its elders, the\\nchristian in the assertions of the\\nfounder of the church.  so, too, it\\nwill not be admitted that all for\\nwhich men sacrificed life and\\nhappiness in former centuries was\\nnothing but delusion: perhaps it is\\nalleged these things were degrees\\nof truth.  but what is really meant is\\nthat, if a person sincerely\\nbelieves a thing and has fought and died for\\nhis faith, it would be\\ntoo _unjust_ if only delusion had inspired him.\\nsuch a state of\\naffairs seems to contradict eternal justice.  for that\\nreason the\\nheart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head the\\njudgment:\\nbetween moral conduct and intellectual insight there must\\nalways exist\\nan inherent connection.  it is, unfortunately, otherwise:\\nfor there is\\nno eternal justice.\\n\\n\\n54\\n\\n=falsehood.=--why do men, as a rule, speak\\nthe truth in the ordinary\\naffairs of life?  certainly not for the\\nreason that a god has forbidden\\nlying.  but because first: it is more\\nconvenient, as falsehood entails\\ninvention, make-believe and\\nrecollection (wherefore swift says that\\nwhoever invents a lie seldom\\nrealises the heavy burden he takes up: he\\nmust, namely, for every lie\\nthat he tells, insert twenty more).\\ntherefore, because in plain\\nordinary relations of life it is expedient\\nto say without\\ncircumlocution: i want this, i have done this, and the\\nlike;\\ntherefore, because the way of freedom and certainty is surer than\\nthat\\nof ruse.--but if it happens that a child is brought up in sinister\\ndomestic circumstances, it will then indulge in falsehood as matter of\\ncourse, and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt:\\nan\\ninclination for truth, an aversion to falsehood, is quite foreign\\nand\\nuncongenial to it, and hence it lies in all innocence.\\n\\n\\n55\\n=ethic discredited for faith\\'s sake.=--no power can sustain itself\\nwhen\\nit is represented by mere humbugs: the catholic church may\\npossess ever\\nso many \"worldly\" sources of strength, but its true might\\nis comprised\\nin those still numberless priestly natures who make their\\nlives stern\\nand strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are\\neloquent of night\\nvigils, fasts, ardent prayer, perhaps even of whip\\nlashes: these things\\nmake men tremble and cause them anxiety: what, if\\nit be really\\nimperative to live thus?  this is the dreadful question\\nwhich their\\naspect occasions.  as they spread this doubt, they lay\\nanew the prop of\\ntheir power: even the free thinkers dare not oppose\\nsuch\\ndisinterestedness with severe truth and cry: \"thou deceived one,\\ndeceive not!\"--only the difference of standpoint separates them from\\nhim: no difference in goodness or badness.  but things we cannot\\naccomplish ourselves, we are apt to criticise unfairly.  thus we are\\ntold\\nof the cunning and perverted acts of the jesuits, but we overlook\\nthe\\nself mastery that each jesuit imposes upon himself and also the\\nfact\\nthat the easy life which the jesuit manuals advocate is for the\\nbenefit,\\nnot of the jesuits but the laity.  indeed, it may be\\nquestioned whether\\nwe enlightened ones would become equally competent\\nworkers as the result\\nof similar tactics and organization, and equally\\nworthy of admiration as\\nthe result of self mastery, indefatigable\\nindustry and devotion.\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n=victory of knowledge over radical\\nevil.=--it proves a material gain to\\nhim who would attain knowledge to\\nhave had during a considerable period\\nthe idea that mankind is a\\nradically bad and perverted thing: it is a\\nfalse idea, as is its\\nopposite, but it long held sway and its roots have\\nreached down even\\nto ourselves and our present world.  in order to\\nunderstand\\n_ourselves_ we must understand _it_; but in order to attain a\\nloftier\\nheight we must step above it.  we then perceive that there is no\\nsuch\\nthing as sin in the metaphysical sense: but also, in the same\\nsense,\\nno such thing as virtue; that this whole domain of ethical\\nnotions is\\none of constant variation; that there are higher and deeper\\nconceptions of good and evil, moral and immoral.  whoever desires no\\nmore\\nof things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of\\nmind and\\nwill at most err through lack of knowledge, but scarcely\\nthrough\\neagerness for knowledge (or through sin, as the world calls\\nit). he will\\nnot ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and\\nrooted out; but\\nhis single, all powerful ambition to _know_ as\\nthoroughly and as fully\\nas possible, will soothe him and moderate all\\nthat is strenuous in his\\ncircumstances.  moreover, he is now rid of a\\nnumber of disturbing\\nnotions; he is no longer beguiled by such words\\nas hell-pain,\\nsinfulness, unworthiness: he sees in them merely the\\nflitting shadow\\npictures of false views of life and of the world.\\n\\n\\n57\\n=ethic as man\\'s self-analysis.=--a good author, whose heart is really\\nin\\nhis work, wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if\\nonly\\nthereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain.  the maid\\nin love\\nwishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion\\nthrough\\nthe faithlessness of her beloved.  the soldier wishes to\\nsacrifice his\\nlife on the field of his fatherland\\'s victory: for in\\nthe victory of his\\nfatherland his highest end is attained.  the mother\\ngives her child what\\nshe deprives herself of--sleep, the best\\nnourishment and, in certain\\ncircumstances, her health, her self.--but\\nare all these acts unegoistic?\\nare these moral deeds miracles because\\nthey are, in schopenhauer\\'s\\nphrase \"impossible and yet accomplished\"?\\nis it not evident that in all\\nfour cases man loves one part of\\nhimself, (a thought, a longing, an\\nexperience) more than he loves\\nanother part of himself?  that he thus\\nanalyses his being and\\nsacrifices one part of it to another part?  is\\nthis essentially\\ndifferent from the behavior of the obstinate man who\\nsays \"i would\\nrather be shot than go a step out of my way for this\\nfellow\"?--\\npreference for something (wish, impulse, longing) is present\\nin all\\nfour instances: to yield to it, with all its consequences, is not\\n\"unegoistic.\"--in the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not\\nas\\nindividuum but as dividuum.\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\n=what can be promised.=--actions\\ncan be promised, but not feelings, for\\nthese are involuntary.  whoever\\npromises somebody to love him always, or\\nto hate him always, or to be\\never true to him, promises something that\\nit is out of his power to\\nbestow.  but he really can promise such courses\\nof conduct as are the\\nordinary accompaniments of love, of hate, of\\nfidelity, but which may\\nalso have their source in motives quite\\ndifferent: for various ways\\nand motives lead to the same conduct.  the\\npromise to love someone\\nalways, means, consequently: as long as i love\\nyou, i will manifest\\nthe deportment of love; but if i cease to love you\\nmy deportment,\\nalthough from some other motive, will be just the same,\\nso that to the\\npeople about us it will seem as if my love remained\\nunchanged.--hence\\nit is the continuance of the deportment of love that\\nis promised in\\nevery instance in which eternal love (provided no element\\nof self\\ndeception be involved) is sworn.\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n=intellect and ethic.=--one\\nmust have a good memory to be able to keep\\nthe promises one makes.\\none must have a strong imagination in order to\\nfeel sympathy.  so\\nclosely is ethics connected with intellectual\\ncapacity.\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n=desire\\nfor vengeance and vengeance itself.=--to meditate revenge and\\nattain\\nit is tantamount to an attack of fever, that passes away: but to\\nmeditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain\\nit\\nis tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady, or poisoning of\\nbody\\nand soul.  ethics, which takes only the motive into account,\\nrates both\\ncases alike: people generally estimate the first case as\\nthe worst\\n(because of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may\\nentail).\\nboth views are short sighted.\\n\\n\\n61\\n\\n=ability to\\nwait.=--ability to wait is so hard to acquire that great\\npoets have\\nnot disdained to make inability to wait the central motive of\\ntheir\\npoems.  so shakespeare in othello, sophocles in ajax, whose suicide\\nwould not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to\\ncool\\nhis ardor for a day, as the oracle foreboded: apparently he would\\nthen\\nhave repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought\\nand\\nhave said to himself: who has not already, in my situation,\\nmistaken a\\nsheep for a hero?  is it so extraordinary a thing?  on the\\ncontrary it is\\nsomething universally human: ajax should thus have\\nsoothed himself.\\npassion will not wait: the tragic element in the\\nlives of great men does\\nnot generally consist in their conflict with\\ntime and the inferiority\\nof their fellowmen but in their inability to\\nput off their work a year\\nor two: they cannot wait.--in all duels, the\\nfriends who advise have but\\nto ascertain if the principals can wait:\\nif this be not possible, a duel\\nis rational inasmuch as each of the\\ncombatants may say: \"either i\\ncontinue to live and the other dies\\ninstantly, or vice versa.\"  to wait\\nin such circumstances would be\\nequivalent to the frightful martyrdom of\\nenduring dishonor in the\\npresence of him responsible for the dishonor:\\nand this can easily cost\\nmore anguish than life is worth.\\n\\n\\n62\\n\\n=glutting revenge.=--coarse\\nmen, who feel a sense of injury, are in the\\nhabit of rating the extent\\nof their injury as high as possible and of\\nstating the occasion of it\\nin greatly exaggerated language, in order to\\nbe able to feast\\nthemselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thus\\naroused.\\n\\n\\n63\\n=value of disparagement.=--not a few, perhaps the majority of men,\\nfind\\nit necessary, in order to retain their self esteem and a certain\\nuprightness in conduct, to mentally disparage and belittle all the\\npeople they know.  but as the inferior natures are in the majority and\\nas\\na great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this\\nuprightness,\\nso--\\n\\n\\n64\\n\\n=the man in a rage.=--we should be on our\\nguard against the man who is\\nenraged against us, as against one who\\nhas attempted our life, for the\\nfact that we still live consists\\nsolely in the inability to kill: were\\nlooks sufficient, it would have\\nbeen all up with us long since.  to\\nreduce anyone to silence by\\nphysical manifestations of savagery or by a\\nterrorizing process is a\\nrelic of under civilization.  so, too, that cold\\nlook which great\\npersonages cast upon their servitors is a remnant of\\nthe caste\\ndistinction between man and man; a specimen of rude antiquity:\\nwomen,\\nthe conservers of the old, have maintained this survival, too,\\nmore\\nperfectly than men.\\n\\n\\n65\\n\\n=whither honesty may lead.=--someone once\\nhad the bad habit of\\nexpressing himself upon occasion, and with\\nperfect honesty, on the\\nsubject of the motives of his conduct, which\\nwere as good or as bad as\\nthe motives of all men.  he aroused first\\ndisfavor, then suspicion,\\nbecame gradually of ill repute and was\\npronounced a person of whom\\nsociety should beware, until at last the\\nlaw took note of such a\\nperverted being for reasons which usually have\\nno weight with it or to\\nwhich it closes its eyes.  lack of taciturnity\\nconcerning what is\\nuniversally held secret, and an irresponsible\\npredisposition to see what\\nno one wants to see--oneself--brought him\\nto prison and to early death.\\n\\n\\n66\\n\\n=punishable, not punished.=--our\\ncrime against criminals consists in the\\nfact that we treat them as\\nrascals.\\n\\n\\n67\\n\\n=sancta simplicitas of virtue.=--every virtue has its\\nprivilege: for\\nexample, that of contributing its own little bundle of\\nwood to the\\nfuneral pyre of one condemned.\\n\\n\\n68\\n\\n=morality and\\nconsequence.=--not alone the beholders of an act generally\\nestimate\\nthe ethical or unethical element in it by the result: no, the\\none who\\nperformed the act does the same.  for the motives and the\\nintentions\\nare seldom sufficiently apparent, and amid them the memory\\nitself\\nseems to become clouded by the results of the act, so that a man\\noften\\nascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remote\\nmotives\\nas the direct ones.  success often imparts to an action all the\\nbrilliance and honor of good intention, while failure throws the\\nshadow\\nof conscience over the most estimable deeds.  hence arises the\\nfamiliar\\nmaxim of the politician: \"give me only success: with it i can\\nwin all\\nthe noble souls over to my side--and make myself noble even in\\nmy own\\neyes.\"--in like manner will success prove an excellent\\nsubstitute for a\\nbetter argument.  to this very day many well educated\\nmen think the\\ntriumph of christianity over greek philosophy is a proof\\nof the superior\\ntruth of the former--although in this case it was\\nsimply the coarser and\\nmore powerful that triumphed over the more\\ndelicate and intellectual.  as\\nregards superiority of truth, it is\\nevident that because of it the\\nreviving sciences have connected\\nthemselves, point for point, with the\\nphilosophy of epicurus, while\\nchristianity has, point for point,\\nrecoiled from it.\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n=love and\\njustice.=--why is love so highly prized at the expense of\\njustice and\\nwhy are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if it\\nwere a far\\nhigher entity than the latter?  is the former not palpably a\\nfar more\\nstupid thing than the latter?--certainly, and on that very\\naccount so\\nmuch the more agreeable to everybody: it is blind and has a\\nrich horn\\nof plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyone,\\neven when\\nthey are unmerited, even when no thanks are returned.  it is\\nimpartial\\nlike the rain, which according to the bible and experience,\\nwets not\\nalone the unjust but, in certain circumstances, the just as\\nwell, and\\nto their skins at that.\\n\\n\\n70\\n\\n=execution.=--how comes it that every\\nexecution causes us more pain than\\na murder?  it is the coolness of\\nthe executioner, the painful\\npreparation, the perception that here a\\nman is being used as an\\ninstrument for the intimidation of others.\\nfor the guilt is not punished\\neven if there be any: this is ascribable\\nto the teachers, the parents,\\nthe environment, in ourselves, not in\\nthe murderer--i mean the\\npredisposing circumstances.\\n\\n\\n71\\n=hope.=--pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it.  it\\nwas\\nthe gift of the gods to men, a gift of most enticing appearance\\nexternally and called the \"box of happiness.\"  thereupon all the\\nevils,\\n(living, moving things) flew out: from that time to the present\\nthey fly\\nabout and do ill to men by day and night.  one evil only did\\nnot fly out\\nof the box: pandora shut the lid at the behest of zeus and\\nit remained\\ninside.  now man has this box of happiness perpetually in\\nthe house and\\ncongratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it; it\\nis at his\\nservice: he grasps it whenever he is so disposed, for he\\nknows not that\\nthe box which pandora brought was a box of evils.\\nhence he looks upon\\nthe one evil still remaining as the greatest\\nsource of happiness--it is\\nhope.--zeus intended that man,\\nnotwithstanding the evils oppressing him,\\nshould continue to live and\\nnot rid himself of life, but keep on making\\nhimself miserable.  for\\nthis purpose he bestowed hope upon man: it is, in\\ntruth, the greatest\\nof evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man.\\n\\n\\n72\\n\\n=degree of moral\\nsusceptibility unknown.=--the fact that one has or has\\nnot had certain\\nprofoundly moving impressions and insights into\\nthings--for example,\\nan unjustly executed, slain or martyred father, a\\nfaithless wife, a\\nshattering, serious accident,--is the factor upon\\nwhich the excitation\\nof our passions to white heat principally depends,\\nas well as the\\ncourse of our whole lives.  no one knows to what lengths\\ncircumstances\\n(sympathy, emotion) may lead him.  he does not know the\\nfull extent of\\nhis own susceptibility.  wretched environment makes him\\nwretched.  it\\nis as a rule not the quality of our experience but its\\nquantity upon\\nwhich depends the development of our superiority or\\ninferiority, from\\nthe point of view of good and evil.\\n\\n\\n73\\n\\n=the martyr against his\\nwill.=--in a certain movement there was a man\\nwho was too cowardly and\\nvacillating ever to contradict his comrades.  he\\nwas made use of in\\neach emergency, every sacrifice was demanded of him\\nbecause he feared\\nthe disfavor of his comrades more than he feared\\ndeath: he was a\\npetty, abject spirit.  they perceived this and upon the\\nfoundation of\\nthe qualities just mentioned they elevated him to the\\naltitude of a\\nhero, and finally even of a martyr.  although the cowardly\\ncreature\\nalways inwardly said no, he always said yes with his lips, even\\nupon\\nthe scaffold, where he died for the tenets of his party: for beside\\nhim stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look\\nand\\nword that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude\\nand\\nhas ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character.\\n74\\n\\n=general standard.=--one will rarely err if extreme actions be\\nascribed\\nto vanity, ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to\\nfear.\\n\\n\\n75\\n\\n=misunderstanding of virtue.=--whoever has obtained his\\nexperience of\\nvice in connection with pleasure as in the case of one\\nwith a youth of\\nwild oats behind him, comes to the conclusion that\\nvirtue must be\\nconnected with self denial.  whoever, on the other\\nhand, has been very\\nmuch plagued by his passions and vices, longs to\\nfind in virtue the rest\\nand peace of the soul.  that is why it is\\npossible for two virtuous\\npeople to misunderstand one another wholly.\\n76\\n\\n=the ascetic.=--the ascetic makes out of virtue a slavery.\\n\\n\\n77\\n=honor transferred from persons to things.=--actions prompted by love\\nor\\nby the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honored\\nwherever they are manifest.  hence is magnified the value set upon\\nwhatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to self\\nsacrifice: although in themselves they may be worth nothing much.  a\\nvaliant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for.\\n\\n\\n78\\n=ambition a substitute for moral feeling.=--moral feeling should never\\nbecome extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition.  the\\nambitious\\ncan get along without moral feeling just as well as with it.\\n--hence the\\nsons of retired, ambitionless families, generally become\\nby a series of\\nrapid gradations, when they lose moral feeling, the\\nmost absolute\\nlunkheads.\\n\\n\\n79\\n\\n=vanity enriches.=--how poor the human\\nmind would be without vanity!  as\\nit is, it resembles a well stacked\\nand ever renewed ware-emporium that\\nattracts buyers of every class:\\nthey can find almost everything, have\\nalmost everything, provided they\\nbring with them the right kind of\\nmoney--admiration.\\n\\n\\n80\\n\\n=senility\\nand death.=--apart from the demands made by religion, it may\\nwell be\\nasked why it is more honorable in an aged man, who feels the\\ndecline\\nof his powers, to await slow extinction than to fix a term to\\nhis\\nexistence himself?  suicide in such a case is a quite natural and due\\nproceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason: and\\ndid\\nin fact command respect during the times of the masters of greek\\nphilosophy and the bravest roman patriots, who usually died by their\\nown\\nhand.  eagerness, on the other hand, to keep alive from day to day\\nwith\\nthe anxious counsel of physicians, without capacity to attain any\\nnearer\\nto one\\'s ideal of life, is far less worthy of respect.--\\nreligions are\\nvery rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide: hence\\nthey ingratiate\\nthemselves with those who cling to life.\\n\\n\\n81\\n=delusions regarding victim and regarding evil doer.=--when the rich\\nman\\ntakes a possession away from the poor man (for example, a prince\\nwho\\ndeprives a plebeian of his beloved) there arises in the mind of\\nthe poor\\nman a delusion: he thinks the rich man must be wholly\\nperverted to take\\nfrom him the little that he has.  but the rich man\\nappreciates the value\\nof a single possession much less because he is\\naccustomed to many\\npossessions, so that he cannot put himself in the\\nplace of the poor man\\nand does not act by any means as ill as the\\nlatter supposes.  both have a\\ntotally false idea of each other.  the\\niniquities of the mighty which\\nbulk most largely in history are not\\nnearly so monstrous as they seem.\\nthe hereditary consciousness of\\nbeing a superior being with superior\\nenvironment renders one very\\ncallous and lulls the conscience to rest.\\nwe all feel, when the\\ndifference between ourselves and some other being\\nis exceedingly\\ngreat, that no element of injustice can be involved, and\\nwe kill a fly\\nwith no qualms of conscience whatever.  so, too, it is no\\nindication\\nof wickedness in xerxes (whom even the greeks represent as\\nexceptionally noble) that he deprived a father of his son and had him\\ndrawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesome,\\nominous distrust of an entire expedition: the individual was in this\\ncase brushed aside as a pestiferous insect.  he was too low and mean\\nto\\njustify continued sentiments of compunction in the ruler of the\\nworld.\\nindeed no cruel man is ever as cruel, in the main, as his\\nvictim thinks.\\nthe idea of pain is never the same as the sensation.\\nthe rule is\\nprecisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge, and\\nof the\\njournalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods, leads\\npublic\\nopinion astray.  cause and effect are in all these instances\\nentwined\\nwith totally different series of feeling and thoughts,\\nwhereas it is\\nunconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and\\nthink exactly\\nalike, and because of this assumption the guilt of the\\none is based upon\\nthe pain of the other.\\n\\n\\n82\\n\\n=the soul\\'s skin.=--as\\nthe bones, flesh, entrails and blood vessels are\\nenclosed by a skin\\nthat renders the aspect of men endurable, so the\\nimpulses and passions\\nof the soul are enclosed by vanity: it is the skin\\nof the soul.\\n\\n\\n83\\n=sleep of virtue.=--if virtue goes to sleep, it will be more vigorous\\nwhen it awakes.\\n\\n\\n84\\n\\n=subtlety of shame.=--men are not ashamed of\\nobscene thoughts, but they\\nare ashamed when they suspect that obscene\\nthoughts are attributed to\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n85\\n\\n=naughtiness is rare.=--most\\npeople are too much absorbed in themselves\\nto be bad.\\n\\n\\n86\\n\\n=the mite\\nin the balance.=--we are praised or blamed, as the one or the\\nother\\nmay be expedient, for displaying to advantage our power of\\ndiscernment.\\n\\n\\n87\\n\\n=luke 18:14 improved.=--he that humbleth himself\\nwisheth to be exalted.\\n\\n\\n88\\n\\n=prevention of suicide.=--there is a\\njustice according to which we may\\ndeprive a man of life, but none that\\npermits us to deprive him of death:\\nthis is merely cruelty.\\n\\n\\n89\\n=vanity.=--we set store by the good opinion of men, first because it\\nis\\nof use to us and next because we wish to give them pleasure\\n(children\\ntheir parents, pupils their teacher, and well disposed\\npersons all\\nothers generally). only when the good opinion of men is\\nimportant to\\nsomebody, apart from personal advantage or the desire to\\ngive pleasure,\\ndo we speak of vanity.  in this last case, a man wants\\nto give himself\\npleasure, but at the expense of his fellow creatures,\\ninasmuch as he\\ninspires them with a false opinion of himself or else\\ninspires \"good\\nopinion\" in such a way that it is a source of pain to\\nothers (by\\narousing envy). the individual generally seeks, through the\\nopinion of\\nothers, to attest and fortify the opinion he has of\\nhimself; but the\\npotent influence of authority--an influence as old as\\nman himself--leads\\nmany, also, to strengthen their own opinion of\\nthemselves by means of\\nauthority, that is, to borrow from others the\\nexpedient of relying more\\nupon the judgment of their fellow men than\\nupon their own.--interest in\\noneself, the wish to please oneself\\nattains, with the vain man, such\\nproportions that he first misleads\\nothers into a false, unduly exalted\\nestimate of himself and then\\nrelies upon the authority of others for his\\nself estimate; he thus\\ncreates the delusion that he pins his faith\\nto.--it must, however, be\\nadmitted that the vain man does not desire to\\nplease others so much as\\nhimself and he will often go so far, on this\\naccount, as to overlook\\nhis own interests: for he often inspires his\\nfellow creatures with\\nmalicious envy and renders them ill disposed in\\norder that he may thus\\nincrease his own delight in himself.\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\n=limits of the love of\\nmankind.=--every man who has declared that some\\nother man is an ass or\\na scoundrel, gets angry when the other man\\nconclusively shows that the\\nassertion was erroneous.\\n\\n\\n91\\n\\n=weeping morality.=--how much delight\\nmorality occasions!  think of the\\nocean of pleasing tears that has\\nflowed from the narration of noble,\\ngreat-hearted deeds!--this charm\\nof life would disappear if the belief\\nin complete irresponsibility\\ngained the upper hand.\\n\\n\\n92\\n\\n=origin of justice.=--justice\\n(reasonableness) has its origin among\\napproximate equals in power, as\\nthucydides (in the dreadful conferences\\nof the athenian and melian\\nenvoys) has rightly conceived.  thus, where\\nthere exists no\\ndemonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but to\\nmutual, useless\\ndamage, the reflection arises that an understanding\\nwould best be\\narrived at and some compromise entered into.  the\\nreciprocal nature is\\nhence the first nature of justice.  each party makes\\nthe other content\\ninasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highly\\nthan the other.\\neach surrenders to the other what the other wants and\\nreceives in\\nreturn its own desire.  justice is therefore reprisal and\\nexchange\\nupon the basis of an approximate equality of power.  thus\\nrevenge\\npertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort of\\nreciprocity.  equally so, gratitude.--justice reverts naturally to the\\nstandpoint of self preservation, therefore to the egoism of this\\nconsideration: \"why should i injure myself to no purpose and perhaps\\nnever attain my end?\"--so much for the origin of justice.  only\\nbecause\\nmen, through mental habits, have forgotten the original motive\\nof so\\ncalled just and rational acts, and also because for thousands of\\nyears\\nchildren have been brought to admire and imitate such acts, have\\nthey\\ngradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical.  upon\\nthis\\nappearance is founded the high estimate of them, which, moreover,\\nlike\\nall estimates, is continually developing, for whatever is highly\\nesteemed is striven for, imitated, made the object of self sacrifice,\\nwhile the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is, by each\\nindividual, ascribed to the thing esteemed.--how slightly moral would\\nthe world appear without forgetfulness!  a poet could say that god had\\nposted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of\\nhuman\\nmerit!\\n\\n\\n93\\n\\n=concerning the law of the weaker.=--whenever any\\nparty, for instance, a\\nbesieged city, yields to a stronger party,\\nunder stipulated conditions,\\nthe counter stipulation is that there be\\na reduction to insignificance,\\na burning and destruction of the city\\nand thus a great damage inflicted\\nupon the stronger party.  thus\\narises a sort of equalization principle\\nupon the basis of which a law\\ncan be established.  the enemy has an\\nadvantage to gain by its\\nmaintenance.--to this extent there is also a\\nlaw between slaves and\\nmasters, limited only by the extent to which the\\nslave may be useful\\nto his master.  the law goes originally only so far\\nas the one party\\nmay appear to the other potent, invincible, stable, and\\nthe like.  to\\nsuch an extent, then, the weaker has rights, but very\\nlimited ones.\\nhence the famous dictum that each has as much law on his\\nside as his\\npower extends (or more accurately, as his power is believed\\nto\\nextend).\\n\\n\\n94\\n\\n=the three phases of morality hitherto.=--it is the\\nfirst evidence that\\nthe animal has become human when his conduct\\nceases to be based upon the\\nimmediately expedient, but upon the\\npermanently useful; when he has,\\ntherefore, grown utilitarian, capable\\nof purpose.  thus is manifested the\\nfirst rule of reason.  a still\\nhigher stage is attained when he regulates\\nhis conduct upon the basis\\nof honor, by means of which he gains mastery\\nof himself and surrenders\\nhis desires to principles; this lifts him far\\nabove the phase in which\\nhe was actuated only by considerations of\\npersonal advantage as he\\nunderstood it.  he respects and wishes to be\\nrespected.  this means\\nthat he comprehends utility as a thing dependent\\nupon what his opinion\\nof others is and their opinion of him.  finally he\\nregulates his\\nconduct (the highest phase of morality hitherto attained)\\nby his own\\nstandard of men and things.  he himself decides, for himself\\nand for\\nothers, what is honorable and what is useful.  he has become a\\nlaw\\ngiver to opinion, upon the basis of his ever higher developing\\nconception of the utilitarian and the honorable.  knowledge makes him\\ncapable of placing the highest utility, (that is, the universal,\\nenduring utility) before merely personal utility,--of placing\\nennobling\\nrecognition of the enduring and universal before the merely\\ntemporary:\\nhe lives and acts as a collective individuality.\\n\\n\\n95\\n=ethic of the developed individual.=--hitherto the altruistic has been\\nlooked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct, and it\\nis manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility that\\nprompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct.  must not a\\nradical departure from this point of view be imminent, now that it is\\nbeing ever more clearly perceived that in the most personal\\nconsiderations the most general welfare is attained: so that conduct\\ninspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just the\\nsort which has its origin in the present conception of morality (as a\\nuniversal utilitarianism)? to contemplate oneself as a complete\\npersonality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all\\nthat\\none does--this is productive of better results than any\\nsympathetic\\nsusceptibility and conduct in behalf of others.  indeed we\\nall suffer\\nfrom such disparagement of our own personalities, which are\\nat present\\nmade to deteriorate from neglect.  capacity is, in fact,\\ndivorced from\\nour personality in most cases, and sacrificed to the\\nstate, to science,\\nto the needy, as if it were the bad which deserved\\nto be made a\\nsacrifice.  now, we are willing to labor for our\\nfellowmen but only to\\nthe extent that we find our own highest\\nadvantage in so doing, no more,\\nno less.  the whole matter depends\\nupon what may be understood as one\\'s\\nadvantage: the crude,\\nundeveloped, rough individualities will be the\\nvery ones to estimate\\nit most inadequately.\\n\\n\\n96\\n\\n=usage and ethic.=--to be moral, virtuous,\\npraiseworthy means to yield\\nobedience to ancient law and hereditary\\nusage.  whether this obedience be\\nrendered readily or with difficulty\\nis long immaterial.  enough that it\\nbe rendered.  \"good\" finally comes\\nto mean him who acts in the\\ntraditional manner, as a result of\\nheredity or natural disposition, that\\nis to say does what is customary\\nwith scarcely an effort, whatever that\\nmay be (for example revenges\\ninjuries when revenge, as with the ancient\\ngreeks, was part of good\\nmorals). he is called good because he is good\\n\"to some purpose,\" and\\nas benevolence, sympathy, considerateness,\\nmoderation and the like\\ncome, in the general course of conduct, to be\\nfinally recognized as\\n\"good to some purpose\" (as utilitarian) the\\nbenevolent man, the\\nhelpful man, is duly styled \"good\". (at first other\\nand more important\\nkinds of utilitarian qualities stand in the\\nforeground.) bad is \"not\\nhabitual\" (unusual), to do things not in\\naccordance with usage, to\\noppose the traditional, however rational or\\nthe reverse the\\ntraditional may be.  to do injury to one\\'s social group\\nor community\\n(and to one\\'s neighbor as thus understood) is looked upon,\\nthrough all\\nthe variations of moral laws, in different ages, as the\\npeculiarly\\n\"immoral\" act, so that to-day we associate the word \"bad\"\\nwith\\ndeliberate injury to one\\'s neighbor or community.  \"egoistic\" and\\n\"non-egoistic\" do not constitute the fundamental opposites that have\\nbrought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral, good\\nand bad; but adherence to traditional custom, and emancipation from\\nit.\\nhow the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial; in any\\nevent it\\nhad no reference to good and bad or any categorical\\nimperative but to\\nthe all important end of maintaining and sustaining\\nthe community, the\\nrace, the confederation, the nation.  every\\nsuperstitious custom that\\noriginated in a misinterpreted event or\\ncasualty entailed some\\ntradition, to adhere to which is moral.  to\\nbreak loose from it is\\ndangerous, more prejudicial to the community\\nthan to the individual\\n(because divinity visits the consequences of\\nimpiety and sacrilege upon\\nthe community rather than upon the\\nindividual). now every tradition\\ngrows ever more venerable--the more\\nremote is its origin, the more\\nconfused that origin is.  the reverence\\ndue to it increases from\\ngeneration to generation.  the tradition\\nfinally becomes holy and\\ninspires awe.  thus it is that the precept of\\npiety is a far loftier\\nmorality than that inculcated by altruistic\\nconduct.\\n\\n\\n97\\n\\n=delight in the moral.=--a potent species of joy (and\\nthereby the source\\nof morality) is custom.  the customary is done more\\neasily, better,\\ntherefore preferably.  a pleasure is felt in it and\\nexperience thus shows\\nthat since this practice has held its own it\\nmust be good.  a manner or\\nmoral that lives and lets live is thus\\ndemonstrated advantageous,\\nnecessary, in contradistinction to all new\\nand not yet adopted\\npractices.  the custom is therefore the blending\\nof the agreeable and the\\nuseful.  moreover it does not require\\ndeliberation.  as soon as man can\\nexercise compulsion, he exercises it\\nto enforce and establish his\\ncustoms, for they are to him attested\\nlifewisdom.  so, too, a community\\nof individuals constrains each one\\nof their number to adopt the same\\nmoral or custom.  the error herein\\nis this: because a certain custom has\\nbeen agreeable to the feelings\\nor at least because it proves a means of\\nmaintenance, this custom must\\nbe imperative, for it is regarded as the\\nonly thing that can possibly\\nbe consistent with well being.  the well\\nbeing of life seems to spring\\nfrom it alone.  this conception of the\\ncustomary as a condition of\\nexistence is carried into the slightest\\ndetail of morality.  inasmuch\\nas insight into true causation is quite\\nrestricted in all inferior\\npeoples, a superstitious anxiety is felt that\\neverything be done in\\ndue routine.  even when a custom is exceedingly\\nburdensome it is\\npreserved because of its supposed vital utility.  it is\\nnot known that\\nthe same degree of satisfaction can be experienced\\nthrough some other\\ncustom and even higher degrees of satisfaction, too.\\nbut it is fully\\nappreciated that all customs do become more agreeable\\nwith the lapse\\nof time, no matter how difficult they may have been found\\nin the\\nbeginning, and that even the severest way of life may be rendered\\na\\nmatter of habit and therefore a pleasure.\\n\\n\\n98\\n\\n=pleasure and social\\ninstinct.=--through his relations with other men,\\nman derives a new\\nspecies of delight in those pleasurable emotions which\\nhis own\\npersonality affords him; whereby the domain of pleasurable\\nemotions is\\nmade infinitely more comprehensive.  no doubt he has\\ninherited many of\\nthese feelings from the brutes, which palpably feel\\ndelight when they\\nsport with one another, as mothers with their young.\\nso, too, the\\nsexual relations must be taken into account: they make\\nevery young\\nwoman interesting to every young man from the standpoint of\\npleasure,\\nand conversely.  the feeling of pleasure originating in human\\nrelationships makes men in general better.  the delight in common, the\\npleasures enjoyed together heighten one another.  the individual feels\\na\\nsense of security.  he becomes better natured.  distrust and malice\\ndissolve.  for the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the\\nsame\\nfeeling in others.  mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire\\nmutual\\nsympathy, the sentiment of homogeneity.  the same effect is\\nfelt also at\\nmutual sufferings, in a common danger, in stormy weather.\\nupon such a\\nfoundation are built the earliest alliances: the object of\\nwhich is the\\nmutual protection and safety from threatening\\nmisfortunes, and the\\nwelfare of each individual.  and thus the social\\ninstinct develops from\\npleasure.\\n\\n\\n99\\n\\n=the guiltless nature of so-\\ncalled bad acts.=--all \"bad\" acts are\\ninspired by the impulse to self\\npreservation or, more accurately, by\\nthe desire for pleasure and for\\nthe avoidance of pain in the individual.\\nthus are they occasioned, but\\nthey are not, therefore, bad.  \"pain self\\nprepared\" does not exist,\\nexcept in the brains of the philosophers, any\\nmore than \"pleasure self\\nprepared\" (sympathy in the schopenhauer sense).\\nin the condition\\nanterior to the state we kill the creature, be it man\\nor ape, that\\nattempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck it\\nourselves\\nshould we happen to be hungry at the time and making for that\\ntree: as\\nwe would do to-day, so far as the brute is concerned, if we\\nwere\\nwandering in savage regions.--the bad acts which most disturb us at\\npresent do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who is\\nguilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it\\nwas\\nwithin his discretion not to have done these evil things.  this\\nbelief in\\ndiscretionary power inspires hate, thirst for revenge,\\nmalice, the\\nentire perversion of the mental processes, whereas we\\nwould feel in no\\nway incensed against the brute, as we hold it\\nirresponsible.  to inflict\\npain not from the instinct of self\\npreservation but in requital--this is\\nthe consequence of false\\njudgment and is equally a guiltless course of\\nconduct.  the individual\\ncan, in that condition which is anterior to the\\nstate, act with\\nfierceness and violence for the intimidation of another\\ncreature, in\\norder to render his own power more secure as a result of\\nsuch acts of\\nintimidation.  thus acts the powerful, the superior, the\\noriginal\\nstate founder, who subjugates the weaker.  he has the right to\\ndo so,\\nas the state nowadays assumes the same right, or, to be more\\naccurate,\\nthere is no right that can conflict with this.  a foundation\\nfor all\\nmorality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality or\\na\\ncollective individuality, for example society, the state, subjects the\\nsingle personalities, hence builds upon their unification and\\nestablishes a bond of union.  morality results from compulsion, it is\\nindeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered in\\norder that pain may be avoided.  at first it is but custom, later free\\nobedience and finally almost instinct.  at last it is (like everything\\nhabitual and natural) associated with pleasure--and is then called\\nvirtue.\\n\\n\\n100\\n\\n=shame.=--shame exists wherever a \"mystery\" exists: but\\nthis is a\\nreligious notion which in the earlier period of human\\ncivilization had\\ngreat vogue.  everywhere there were circumscribed\\nspots to which access\\nwas denied on account of some divine law, except\\nin special\\ncircumstances.  at first these spots were quite extensive,\\ninasmuch as\\nstipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated,\\nwho, when near\\nthem, felt tremors and anxieties.  this sentiment was\\nfrequently\\ntransferred to other relationships, for example to sexual\\nrelations,\\nwhich, as the privilege and gateway of mature age, must be\\nwithdrawn\\nfrom the contemplation of youth for its own advantage:\\nrelations which\\nmany divinities were busy in preserving and\\nsanctifying, images of which\\ndivinities were duly placed in marital\\nchambers as guardians.  (in\\nturkish such an apartment is termed a\\nharem or holy thing, the same word\\nalso designating the vestibule of a\\nmosque). so, too, kingship is\\nregarded as a centre from which power\\nand brilliance stream forth, as a\\nmystery to the subjects, impregnated\\nwith secrecy and shame, sentiments\\nstill quite operative among peoples\\nwho in other respects are without\\nany shame at all.  so, too, is the\\nwhole world of inward states, the\\nso-called \"soul,\" even now, for all\\nnon-philosophical persons, a\\n\"mystery,\" and during countless ages it\\nwas looked upon as a something\\nof divine origin, in direct communion\\nwith deity.  it is, therefore, an\\nadytum and occasions shame.\\n\\n\\n101\\n=judge not.=--care must be taken, in the contemplation of earlier\\nages,\\nthat there be no falling into unjust scornfulness.  the\\ninjustice in\\nslavery, the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and\\npeoples must not\\nbe estimated by our standard.  for in that period the\\ninstinct of justice\\nwas not so highly developed.  who dare reproach\\nthe genoese calvin for\\nburning the physician servetus at the stake?\\nit was a proceeding growing\\nout of his convictions.  and the\\ninquisition, too, had its justification.\\nthe only thing is that the\\nprevailing views were false and led to those\\nproceedings which seem so\\ncruel to us, simply because such views have\\nbecome foreign to us.\\nbesides, what is the burning alive of one\\nindividual compared with\\neternal hell pains for everybody else?  and yet\\nthis idea then had\\nhold of all the world without in the least vitiating,\\nwith its\\nfrightfulness, the other idea of a god.  even we nowadays are\\nhard and\\nmerciless to political revolutionists, but that is because we\\nare in\\nthe habit of believing the state a necessity, and hence the\\ncruelty of\\nthe proceeding is not so much understood as in the other\\ncases where\\nthe points of view are repudiated.  the cruelty to animals\\nshown by\\nchildren and italians is due to the same misunderstanding.  the\\nanimal, owing to the exigencies of the church catechism, is placed too\\nfar below the level of mankind.--much, too, that is frightful and\\ninhuman in history, and which is almost incredible, is rendered less\\natrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one who\\nexecutes are different persons.  the former does not witness the\\nperformance and hence it makes no strong impression on him.  the\\nlatter\\nobeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility.  most\\nprinces and\\nmilitary chieftains appear, through lack of true\\nperception, cruel and\\nhard without really being so.--egoism is not bad\\nbecause the idea of the\\n\"neighbor\"--the word is of christian origin\\nand does not correspond to\\ntruth--is very weak in us, and we feel\\nourselves, in regard to him, as\\nfree from responsibility as if plants\\nand stones were involved.  that\\nanother is in suffering must be\\nlearned and it can never be wholly\\nlearned.\\n\\n\\n102\\n\\n\"=man always does\\nright.=\"--we do not blame nature when she sends a\\nthunder storm and\\nmakes us wet: why then do we term the man who inflicts\\ninjury immoral?\\nbecause in the latter case we assume a voluntary,\\nruling, free will,\\nand in the former necessity.  but this distinction is\\na delusion.\\nmoreover, even the intentional infliction of injury is not,\\nin all\\ncircumstances termed immoral.  thus, we kill a fly intentionally\\nwithout thinking very much about it, simply because its buzzing about\\nis\\ndisagreeable; and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him in\\norder to protect ourselves and society.  in the first case it is the\\nindividual who, for the sake of preserving himself or in order to\\nspare\\nhimself pain, does injury with design: in the second case, it is\\nthe\\nstate.  all ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified\\nby\\nnecessity; that is when it is a matter of self preservation.  but\\nthese\\ntwo points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done\\nby man to\\nmen.  it is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain.  in\\nany sense, it is\\na question, always, of self preservation.  socrates\\nand plato are right:\\nwhatever man does he always does right: that is,\\ndoes what seems to him\\ngood (advantageous) according to the degree of\\nadvancement his intellect\\nhas attained, which is always the measure of\\nhis rational capacity.\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\n=the inoffensive in badness.=--badness\\nhas not for its object the\\ninfliction of pain upon others but simply\\nour own satisfaction as, for\\ninstance, in the case of thirst for\\nvengeance or of nerve excitation.\\nevery act of teasing shows what\\npleasure is caused by the display of\\nour power over others and what\\nfeelings of delight are experienced in\\nthe sense of domination.  is\\nthere, then, anything immoral in feeling\\npleasure in the pain of\\nothers?  is malicious joy devilish, as\\nschopenhauer says?  in the\\nrealm of nature we feel joy in breaking\\nboughs, shattering rocks,\\nfighting with wild beasts, simply to attest\\nour strength thereby.\\nshould not the knowledge that another suffers on\\nour account here, in\\nthis case, make the same kind of act, (which, by\\nthe way, arouses no\\nqualms of conscience in us) immoral also?  but if we\\nhad not this\\nknowledge there would be no pleasure in one\\'s own\\nsuperiority or\\npower, for this pleasure is experienced only in the\\nsuffering of\\nanother, as in the case of teasing.  all pleasure is, in\\nitself,\\nneither good nor bad.  whence comes the conviction that one\\nshould not\\ncause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneself?\\nsimply from\\nthe standpoint of utility, that is, in consideration of the\\nconsequences, of ultimate pain, since the injured party or state will\\ndemand satisfaction and revenge.  this consideration alone can have\\nled\\nto the determination to renounce such pleasure.--sympathy has the\\nsatisfaction of others in view no more than, as already stated,\\nbadness\\nhas the pain of others in view.  for there are at least two\\n(perhaps many\\nmore) elementary ingredients in personal gratification\\nwhich enter\\nlargely into our self satisfaction: one of them being the\\npleasure of\\nthe emotion, of which species is sympathy with tragedy,\\nand another,\\nwhen the impulse is to action, being the pleasure of\\nexercising one\\'s\\npower.  should a sufferer be very dear to us, we\\ndivest ourselves of pain\\nby the performance of acts of sympathy.--with\\nthe exception of some few\\nphilosophers, men have placed sympathy very\\nlow in the rank of moral\\nfeelings: and rightly.\\n\\n\\n104\\n\\n=self\\ndefence.=--if self defence is in general held a valid\\njustification,\\nthen nearly every manifestation of so called immoral\\negoism must be\\njustified, too.  pain is inflicted, robbery or killing\\ndone in order\\nto maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm.\\na man lies\\nwhen cunning and delusion are valid means of self\\npreservation.  to\\ninjure intentionally when our safety and our existence\\nare involved,\\nor the continuance of our well being, is conceded to be\\nmoral.  the\\nstate itself injures from this motive when it hangs\\ncriminals.  in\\nunintentional injury the immoral, of course, can not be\\npresent, as\\naccident alone is involved.  but is there any sort of\\nintentional\\ninjury in which our existence and the maintenance of our\\nwell being be\\nnot involved?  is there such a thing as injuring from\\nabsolute\\nbadness, for example, in the case of cruelty?  if a man does not\\nknow\\nwhat pain an act occasions, that act is not one of wickedness.  thus\\nthe child is not bad to the animal, not evil.  it disturbs and rends\\nit\\nas if it were one of its playthings.  does a man ever fully know\\nhow much\\npain an act may cause another?  as far as our nervous system\\nextends, we\\nshield ourselves from pain.  if it extended further, that\\nis, to our\\nfellow men, we would never cause anyone else any pain\\n(except in such\\ncases as we cause it to ourselves, when we cut\\nourselves, surgically, to\\nheal our ills, or strive and trouble\\nourselves to gain health). we\\nconclude from analogy that something\\npains somebody and can in\\nconsequence, through recollection and the\\npower of imagination, feel\\npain also.  but what a difference there\\nalways is between the tooth ache\\nand the pain (sympathy) that the\\nspectacle of tooth ache occasions!\\ntherefore when injury is inflicted\\nfrom so called badness the degree of\\npain thereby experienced is\\nalways unknown to us: in so far, however, as\\npleasure is felt in the\\nact (a sense of one\\'s own power, of one\\'s own\\nexcitation) the act is\\ncommitted to maintain the well being of the\\nindividual and hence comes\\nunder the purview of self defence and lying\\nfor self preservation.\\nwithout pleasure, there is no life; the struggle\\nfor pleasure is the\\nstruggle for life.  whether the individual shall\\ncarry on this\\nstruggle in such a way that he be called good or in such a\\nway that he\\nbe called bad is something that the standard and the\\ncapacity of his\\nown intellect must determine for him.\\n\\n\\n105\\n\\n=justice that\\nrewards.=--whoever has fully understood the doctrine of\\nabsolute\\nirresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewarding\\nand\\npunishing justice in the idea of justice, if the latter be taken to\\nmean that to each be given his due.  for he who is punished does not\\ndeserve the punishment.  he is used simply as a means to intimidate\\nothers from certain acts.  equally, he who is rewarded does not merit\\nthe\\nreward.  he could not act any differently than he did act.  hence\\nthe\\nreward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and\\nothers\\nas a motive for subsequent acts.  the praise is called out only\\nto him\\nwho is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at\\nthe goal.\\nsomething that comes to someone as his own is neither a\\npunishment nor a\\nreward.  it is given to him from utiliarian\\nconsiderations, without his\\nhaving any claim to it in justice.  hence\\none must say \"the wise man\\npraises not because a good act has been\\ndone\" precisely as was once\\nsaid: \"the wise man punishes not because a\\nbad act has been done but in\\norder that a bad act may not be done.\"\\nif punishment and reward ceased,\\nthere would cease with them the most\\npowerful incentives to certain acts\\nand away from other acts.  the\\npurposes of men demand their continuance\\n[of punishment and reward]\\nand inasmuch as punishment and reward, blame\\nand praise operate most\\npotently upon vanity, these same purposes of men\\nimperatively require\\nthe continuance of vanity.\\n\\n\\n106\\n\\n=the water fall.=--at the sight of a\\nwater fall we may opine that in the\\ncountless curves, spirations and\\ndashes of the waves we behold freedom\\nof the will and of the impulses.\\nbut everything is compulsory,\\neverything can be mathematically\\ncalculated.  thus it is, too, with human\\nacts.  we would be able to\\ncalculate in advance every single action if we\\nwere all knowing, as\\nwell as every advance in knowledge, every delusion,\\nevery bad deed.\\nthe acting individual himself is held fast in the\\nillusion of\\nvolition.  if, on a sudden, the entire movement of the world\\nstopped\\nshort, and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were there\\nto\\ntake advantage of this pause, he could foretell the future of every\\nbeing to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken\\nin\\nthe world\\'s further course.  the deception of the acting individual\\nas\\nregards himself, the assumption of the freedom of the will, is a\\npart of\\nthis computable mechanism.\\n\\n\\n107\\n\\n=non-responsibility and non-\\nguilt.=--the absolute irresponsibility of\\nman for his acts and his\\nnature is the bitterest drop in the cup of him\\nwho has knowledge, if\\nhe be accustomed to behold in responsibility and\\nduty the patent of\\nnobility of his human nature.  all his estimates,\\npreferences,\\ndislikes are thus made worthless and false.  his deepest\\nsentiment,\\nwith which he honored the sufferer, the hero, sprang from an\\nerror.\\nhe may no longer praise, no longer blame, for it is irrational to\\nblame and praise nature and necessity.  just as he cherishes the\\nbeautiful work of art, but does not praise it (as it is incapable of\\ndoing anything for itself), just as he stands in the presence of\\nplants,\\nhe must stand in the presence of human conduct, his own\\nincluded.  he may\\nadmire strength, beauty, capacity, therein, but he\\ncan discern no merit.\\nthe chemical process and the conflict of the\\nelements, the ordeal of\\nthe invalid who strives for convalescence, are\\nno more merits than the\\nsoul-struggles and extremities in which one is\\ntorn this way and that by\\ncontending motives until one finally decides\\nin favor of the\\nstrongest--as the phrase has it, although, in fact, it\\nis the strongest\\nmotive that decides for us.  all these motives,\\nhowever, whatever fine\\nnames we may give them, have grown from the\\nsame roots in which we\\nbelieve the baneful poisons lurk.  between good\\nand bad actions there is\\nno difference in kind but, at most, in\\ndegree.  good acts are sublimated\\nevil.  bad acts are degraded,\\nimbruted good.  the very longing of the\\nindividual for self\\ngratification (together with the fear of being\\ndeprived of it) obtains\\nsatisfaction in all circumstances, let the\\nindividual act as he may,\\nthat is, as he must: be it in deeds of vanity,\\nrevenge, pleasure,\\nutility, badness, cunning, be it in deeds of self\\nsacrifice, sympathy\\nor knowledge.  the degrees of rational capacity\\ndetermine the\\ndirection in which this longing impels: every society,\\nevery\\nindividual has constantly present a comparative classification of\\nbenefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others are\\njudged.  but this standard perpetually changes.  many acts are called\\nbad\\nthat are only stupid, because the degree of intelligence that\\ndecided\\nfor them was low.  indeed, in a certain sense, all acts now\\nare stupid,\\nfor the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet\\nbeen attained\\nwill in time most certainly be surpassed and then, in\\nretrospection, all\\nour present conduct and opinion will appear as\\nnarrow and petty as we\\nnow deem the conduct and opinion of savage\\npeoples and ages.--to\\nperceive all these things may occasion profound\\npain but there is,\\nnevertheless, a consolation.  such pains are birth\\npains.  the butterfly\\ninsists upon breaking through the cocoon, he\\npresses through it, tears\\nit to pieces, only to be blinded and\\nconfused by the strange light, by\\nthe realm of liberty.  by such men\\nas are capable of this sadness--how\\nfew there are!--will the first\\nattempt be made to see if humanity may\\nconvert itself from a thing of\\nmorality to a thing of wisdom.  the sun of\\na new gospel sheds its\\nfirst ray upon the loftiest height in the souls\\nof those few: but the\\nclouds are massed there, too, thicker than ever,\\nand not far apart are\\nthe brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom.\\neverything is necessity\\n--so says the new knowledge: and this knowledge\\nis itself necessity.\\nall is guiltlessness, and knowledge is the way to\\ninsight into this\\nguiltlessness.  if pleasure, egoism, vanity be\\nnecessary to attest the\\nmoral phenomena and their richest blooms, the\\ninstinct for truth and\\naccuracy of knowledge; if delusion and confusion\\nof the imagination\\nwere the only means whereby mankind could gradually\\nlift itself up to\\nthis degree of self enlightenment and self\\nemancipation--who would\\nventure to disparage the means?  who would have\\nthe right to feel sad\\nif made aware of the goal to which those paths\\nlead?  everything in\\nthe domain of ethic is evolved, changeable,\\ntottering; all things\\nflow, it is true--but all things are also in the\\nstream: to their\\ngoal.  though within us the hereditary habit of\\nerroneous judgment,\\nlove, hate, may be ever dominant, yet under the\\ninfluence of awaking\\nknowledge it will ever become weaker: a new habit,\\nthat of\\nunderstanding, not-loving, not-hating, looking from above, grows\\nup\\nwithin us gradually and in the same soil, and may, perhaps, in\\nthousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity\\nto\\ndevelop the wise, guiltless man (conscious of guiltlessness) as\\nunfailingly as it now developes the unwise, irrational, guilt-\\nconscious\\nman--that is to say, the necessary higher step, not the\\nopposite of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe religious life.\\n\\n\\n108\\n\\n=the double contest\\nagainst evil.=--if an evil afflicts us we can either\\nso deal with it\\nas to remove its cause or else so deal with it that its\\neffect upon\\nour feeling is changed: hence look upon the evil as a\\nbenefit of which\\nthe uses will perhaps first become evident in some\\nsubsequent period.\\nreligion and art (and also the metaphysical\\nphilosophy) strive to\\neffect an alteration of the feeling, partly by an\\nalteration of our\\njudgment respecting the experience (for example, with\\nthe aid of the\\ndictum \"whom god loves, he chastizes\") partly by the\\nawakening of a\\njoy in pain, in emotion especially (whence the art of\\ntragedy had its\\norigin). the more one is disposed to interpret away and\\njustify, the\\nless likely he is to look directly at the causes of evil\\nand eliminate\\nthem.  an instant alleviation and narcotizing of pain, as\\nis usual in\\nthe case of tooth ache, is sufficient for him even in the\\nseverest\\nsuffering.  the more the domination of religions and of all\\nnarcotic\\narts declines, the more searchingly do men look to the\\nelimination of\\nevil itself, which is a rather bad thing for the tragic\\npoets--for\\nthere is ever less and less material for tragedy, since the\\ndomain of\\nunsparing, immutable destiny grows constantly more\\ncircumscribed--and\\na still worse thing for the priests, for these last\\nhave lived\\nheretofore upon the narcoticizing of human ill.\\n\\n\\n109\\n\\n=sorrow is\\nknowledge.=--how willingly would not one exchange the false\\nassertions\\nof the homines religiosi that there is a god who commands us\\nto be\\ngood, who is the sentinel and witness of every act, every moment,\\nevery thought, who loves us, who plans our welfare in every\\nmisfortune\\n--how willingly would not one exchange these for truths as\\nhealing,\\nbeneficial and grateful as those delusions!  but there are no\\nsuch\\ntruths.  philosophy can at most set up in opposition to them other\\nmetaphysical plausibilities (fundamental untruths as well). the\\ntragedy\\nof it all is that, although one cannot believe these dogmas of\\nreligion\\nand metaphysics if one adopts in heart and head the potent\\nmethods of\\ntruth, one has yet become, through human evolution, so\\ntender,\\nsusceptible, sensitive, as to stand in need of the most\\neffective means\\nof rest and consolation.  from this state of things\\narises the danger\\nthat, through the perception of truth or, more\\naccurately, seeing\\nthrough delusion, one may bleed to death.  byron\\nhas put this into\\ndeathless verse:\\n\\n     \"sorrow is knowledge: they\\nwho know the most\\n     must mourn the deepest o\\'er the fatal truth,\\nthe tree of knowledge is not that of life.\"\\n\\nagainst such cares there\\nis no better protective than the light fancy of\\nhorace, (at any rate\\nduring the darkest hours and sun eclipses of the\\nsoul) expressed in\\nthe words\\n\\n     \"quid aeternis minorem\\n     consiliis animum fatigas?\\ncur non sub alta vel platano vel hac\\n     pinu jacentes.\"[22]\\n\\n[22]\\nthen wherefore should you, who are mortal, outwear\\n     your soul with\\na profitless burden of care\\n     say, why should we not, flung at ease\\nneath this pine,\\n     or a plane-tree\\'s broad umbrage, quaff gaily our\\nwine?\\n                      (translation of sir theodore martin.)\\n\\nat\\nany rate, light fancy or heavy heartedness of any degree must be\\nbetter than a romantic retrogression and desertion of one\\'s flag, an\\napproach to christianity in any form: for with it, in the present\\nstate\\nof knowledge, one can have nothing to do without hopelessly\\ndefiling\\none\\'s intellectual integrity and surrendering it\\nunconditionally.  these\\nwoes may be painful enough, but without pain\\none cannot become a leader\\nand guide of humanity: and woe to him who\\nwould be such and lacks this\\npure integrity of the intellect!\\n\\n\\n110\\n=the truth in religion.=--in the ages of enlightenment justice was not\\ndone to the importance of religion, of this there can be no doubt.  it\\nis\\nalso equally certain that in the ensuing reaction of enlightenment,\\nthe\\ndemands of justice were far exceeded inasmuch as religion was\\ntreated\\nwith love, even with infatuation and proclaimed as a profound,\\nindeed\\nthe most profound knowledge of the world, which science had but\\nto\\ndivest of its dogmatic garb in order to possess \"truth\" in its\\nunmythical form.  religions must therefore--this was the contention of\\nall foes of enlightenment--sensu allegorico, with regard for the\\ncomprehension of the masses, give expression to that ancient truth\\nwhich\\nis wisdom in itself, inasmuch as all science of modern times has\\nled up\\nto it instead of away from it.  so that between the most\\nancient wisdom\\nof man and all later wisdom there prevails harmony,\\neven similarity of\\nviewpoint; and the advancement of knowledge--if one\\nbe disposed to\\nconcede such a thing--has to do not with its nature but\\nwith its\\npropagation.  this whole conception of religion and science\\nis through\\nand through erroneous, and none would to-day be hardy\\nenough to\\ncountenance it had not schopenhauer\\'s rhetoric taken it\\nunder\\nprotection, this high sounding rhetoric which now gains auditors\\nafter\\nthe lapse of a generation.  much as may be gained from\\nschopenhauer\\'s\\nreligio-ethical human and cosmical oracle as regards\\nthe comprehension\\nof christianity and other religions, it is\\nnevertheless certain that he\\nerred regarding the value of religion to\\nknowledge.  he himself was in\\nthis but a servile pupil of the\\nscientific teachers of his time who had\\nall taken romanticism under\\ntheir protection and renounced the spirit of\\nenlightenment.  had he\\nbeen born in our own time it would have been\\nimpossible for him to\\nhave spoken of the sensus allegoricus of religion.\\nhe would instead\\nhave done truth the justice to say: never has a\\nreligion, directly or\\nindirectly, either as dogma or as allegory,\\ncontained a truth.  for\\nall religions grew out of dread or necessity, and\\ncame into existence\\nthrough an error of the reason.  they have, perhaps,\\nin times of\\ndanger from science, incorporated some philosophical\\ndoctrine or other\\ninto their systems in order to make it possible to\\ncontinue one\\'s\\nexistence within them.  but this is but a theological work\\nof art\\ndating from the time in which a religion began to doubt of\\nitself.\\nthese theological feats of art, which are most common in\\nchristianity\\nas the religion of a learned age, impregnated with\\nphilosophy, have\\nled to this superstition of the sensus allegoricus, as\\nhas, even more,\\nthe habit of the philosophers (namely those\\nhalf-natures, the poetical\\nphilosophers and the philosophising artists)\\nof dealing with their own\\nfeelings as if they constituted the\\nfundamental nature of humanity and\\nhence of giving their own religious\\nfeelings a predominant influence\\nover the structure of their systems.  as\\nthe philosophers mostly\\nphilosophised under the influence of hereditary\\nreligious habits, or\\nat least under the traditional influence of this\\n\"metaphysical\\nnecessity,\" they naturally arrived at conclusions\\nclosely resembling\\nthe judaic or christian or indian religious\\ntenets--resembling, in the\\nway that children are apt to look like their\\nmothers: only in this\\ncase the fathers were not certain as to the\\nmaternity, as easily\\nhappens--but in the innocence of their admiration,\\nthey fabled\\nregarding the family likeness of all religion and science.\\nin reality,\\nthere exists between religion and true science neither\\nrelationship\\nnor friendship, not even enmity: they dwell in different\\nspheres.\\nevery philosophy that lets the religious comet gleam through\\nthe\\ndarkness of its last outposts renders everything within it that\\npurports to be science, suspicious.  it is all probably religion,\\nalthough it may assume the guise of science.--moreover, though all the\\npeoples agree concerning certain religious things, for example, the\\nexistence of a god (which, by the way, as regards this point, is not\\nthe case) this fact would constitute an argument against the thing\\nagreed upon, for example the very existence of a god.  the consensus\\ngentium and especially hominum can probably amount only to an\\nabsurdity.\\nagainst it there is no consensus omnium sapientium\\nwhatever, on any\\npoint, with the exception of which goethe\\'s verse\\nspeaks:\\n\\n     \"all greatest sages to all latest ages\\n         will\\nsmile, wink and slily agree\\n     \\'tis folly to wait till a fool\\'s\\nempty pate\\n         has learned to be knowing and free.\\n     so\\nchildren of wisdom must look upon fools\\n     as creatures who\\'re never\\nthe better for schools.\"\\n\\nstated without rhyme or metre and adapted to\\nour case: the consensus\\nsapientium is to the effect that the consensus\\ngentium amounts to an\\nabsurdity.\\n\\n\\n111\\n\\n=origin of religious\\nworship.=--let us transport ourselves back to the\\ntimes in which\\nreligious life flourished most vigorously and we will\\nfind a\\nfundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share and\\nwhich\\nhas resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once for\\nall\\nso far as we are concerned: this conviction has to do with nature\\nand\\nintercourse with her.  in those times nothing is yet known of\\nnature\\'s\\nlaws.  neither for earth nor for heaven is there a must.  a\\nseason,\\nsunshine, rain can come or stay away as it pleases.  there is\\nwanting,\\nin particular, all idea of natural causation.  if a man rows, it\\nis\\nnot the oar that moves the boat, but rowing is a magical ceremony\\nwhereby a demon is constrained to move the boat.  all illness, death\\nitself, is a consequence of magical influences.  in sickness and death\\nnothing natural is conceived.  the whole idea of \"natural course\" is\\nwanting.  the idea dawns first upon the ancient greeks, that is to say\\nin\\na very late period of humanity, in the conception of a moira [fate]\\nruling over the gods.  if any person shoots off a bow, there is always\\nan\\nirrational strength and agency in the act.  if the wells suddenly\\nrun\\ndry, the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks.\\nit\\nmust have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence\\na\\nhuman being suddenly collapses.  in india, the carpenter (according\\nto\\nlubbock) is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer\\nand\\nhatchet.  a brahmin treats the plume with which he writes, a\\nsoldier the\\nweapon that he takes into the field, a mason his trowel, a\\nlaborer his\\nplow, in the same way.  all nature is, in the opinion of\\nreligious\\npeople, a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing\\nbeings, an\\nimmense mass of complex volitions.  in regard to all that\\ntakes place\\noutside of us no conclusion is permissible that anything\\nwill result\\nthus and so, must result thus and so, that we are\\ncomparatively\\ncalculable and certain in our experiences, that man is\\nthe rule, nature\\nthe ruleless.  this view forms the fundamental\\nconviction that dominates\\ncrude, religion-producing, early\\ncivilizations.  we contemporary men feel\\nexactly the opposite: the\\nricher man now feels himself inwardly, the\\nmore polyphone the music\\nand the sounding of his soul, the more\\npowerfully does the uniformity\\nof nature impress him.  we all, with\\ngoethe, recognize in nature the\\ngreat means of repose for the soul.  we\\nlisten to the pendulum stroke\\nof this great clock with longing for rest,\\nfor absolute calm and\\nquiescence, as if we could drink in the uniformity\\nof nature and\\nthereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself.  formerly\\nit was the\\nreverse: if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crude\\ncivilization, or if we contemplate contemporary savages, we will find\\nthem most strongly influenced by rule, by tradition.  the individual\\nis\\nalmost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with the\\nuniformity of a pendulum.  to him nature--the uncomprehended, fearful,\\nmysterious nature--must seem the domain of freedom, of volition, of\\nhigher power, indeed as an ultra-human degree of destiny, as god.\\nevery\\nindividual in such periods and circumstances feels that his\\nexistence,\\nhis happiness, the existence and happiness of the family,\\nthe state,\\nthe success or failure of every undertaking, must depend\\nupon these\\ndispositions of nature.  certain natural events must occur\\nat the proper\\ntime and certain others must not occur.  how can\\ninfluence be exercised\\nover this fearful unknown, how can this domain\\nof freedom be brought\\nunder subjection?  thus he asks himself, thus he\\nworries: is there no\\nmeans to render these powers of nature as subject\\nto rule and tradition\\nas you are yourself?--the cogitation of the\\nsuperstitious and\\nmagic-deluded man is upon the theme of imposing a\\nlaw upon nature: and\\nto put it briefly, religious worship is the\\nresult of such cogitation.\\nthe problem which is present to every man\\nis closely connected with this\\none: how can the weaker party dictate\\nlaws to the stronger, control its\\nacts in reference to the weaker?  at\\nfirst the most harmless form of\\ninfluence is recollected, that\\ninfluence which is acquired when the\\npartiality of anyone has been\\nwon.  through beseeching and prayer,\\nthrough abject humiliation,\\nthrough obligations to regular gifts and\\npropitiations, through\\nflattering homages, it is possible, therefore, to\\nimpose some guidance\\nupon the forces of nature, to the extent that their\\npartiality be won:\\nlove binds and is bound.  then agreements can be\\nentered into by means\\nof which certain courses of conduct are mutually\\nconcluded, vows are\\nmade and authorities prescribed.  but far more potent\\nis that species\\nof power exercised by means of magic and incantation.  as\\na man is\\nable to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician and\\nrender\\nhim helpless with fear, as the love potion operates at a\\ndistance, so\\ncan the mighty forces of nature, in the opinion of weaker\\nmankind, be\\ncontrolled by similar means.  the principal means of\\neffecting\\nincantations is to acquire control of something belonging to\\nthe party\\nto be influenced, hair, finger nails, food from his table,\\neven his\\npicture or his name.  with such apparatus it is possible to act\\nby\\nmeans of magic, for the basic principle is that to everything\\nspiritual corresponds something corporeal.  with the aid of this\\ncorporeal element the spirit may be bound, injured or destroyed.  the\\ncorporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold\\nof.\\nin the same way that man influences mankind does he influences\\nsome\\nspirit of nature, for this latter has also its corporeal element\\nthat\\ncan be grasped.  the tree, and on the same basis, the seed from\\nwhich it\\ngrew: this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in\\nboth forms the\\nsame spirit is embodied, now large, now small.  a stone\\nthat suddenly\\nrolls, is the body in which the spirit works.  does a\\nhuge boulder lie in\\na lonely moor?  it is impossible to think of\\nmortal power having placed\\nit there.  the stone must have moved itself\\nthere.  that is to say some\\nspirit must dominate it.  everything that\\nhas a body is subject to magic,\\nincluding, therefore, the spirits of\\nnature.  if a god is directly\\nconnected with his portrait, a direct\\ninfluence (by refraining from\\ndevout offerings, by whippings,\\nchainings and the like) can be brought\\nto bear upon him.  the lower\\nclasses in china tie cords around the\\npicture of their god in order to\\ndefy his departing favor, when he has\\nleft them in the lurch, and tear\\nthe picture to pieces, drag it through\\nthe streets into dung heaps and\\ngutters, crying: \"you dog of a spirit,\\nwe housed you in a beautiful\\ntemple, we gilded you prettily, we fed you\\nwell, we brought you\\nofferings, and yet how ungrateful you are!\"  similar\\ndisplays of\\nresentment have been made against pictures of the mother of\\ngod and\\npictures of saints in catholic countries during the present\\ncentury\\nwhen such pictures would not do their duty during times of\\npestilence\\nand drought.\\n\\nthrough all these magical relationships to nature\\ncountless ceremonies\\nare occasioned, and finally, when their\\ncomplexity and confusion grow\\ntoo great, pains are taken to\\nsystematize them, to arrange them so that\\nthe favorable course of\\nnature\\'s progress, namely the great yearly\\ncircle of the seasons, may\\nbe brought about by a corresponding course of\\nthe ceremonial progress.\\nthe aim of religious worship is to influence\\nnature to human\\nadvantage, and hence to instil a subjection to law into\\nher that\\noriginally she has not, whereas at present man desires to find\\nout the\\nsubjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby.\\nin\\nbrief, the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magic\\nbetween man and man, and the magician is older than the priest.  but\\nit\\nrests equally upon other and higher ideas.  it brings into\\nprominence the\\nsympathetic relation of man to man, the existence of\\nbenevolence,\\ngratitude, prayer, of truces between enemies, of loans\\nupon security, of\\narrangements for the protection of property.  man,\\neven in very inferior\\ndegrees of civilization, does not stand in the\\npresence of nature as a\\nhelpless slave, he is not willy-nilly the\\nabsolute servant of nature.  in\\nthe greek development of religion,\\nespecially in the relationship to the\\nolympian gods, it becomes\\npossible to entertain the idea of an existence\\nside by side of two\\ncastes, a higher, more powerful, and a lower, less\\npowerful: but both\\nare bound together in some way, on account of their\\norigin and are one\\nspecies.  they need not be ashamed of one another.\\nthis is the element\\nof distinction in greek religion.\\n\\n\\n112\\n\\n=at the contemplation of\\ncertain ancient sacrificial proceedings.=--how\\nmany sentiments are\\nlost to us is manifest in the union of the farcical,\\neven of the\\nobscene, with the religious feeling.  the feeling that this\\nmixture is\\npossible is becoming extinct.  we realize the mixture only\\nhistorically, in the mysteries of demeter and dionysos and in the\\nchristian easter festivals and religious mysteries.  but we still\\nperceive the sublime in connection with the ridiculous, and the like,\\nthe emotional with the absurd.  perhaps a later age will be unable to\\nunderstand even these combinations.\\n\\n\\n113\\n\\n=christianity as\\nantiquity.=--when on a sunday morning we hear the old\\nbells ringing,\\nwe ask ourselves: is it possible?  all this for a jew\\ncrucified two\\nthousand years ago who said he was god\\'s son?  the proof of\\nsuch an\\nassertion is lacking.--certainly, the christian religion\\nconstitutes\\nin our time a protruding bit of antiquity from very remote\\nages and\\nthat its assertions are still generally believed--although men\\nhave\\nbecome so keen in the scrutiny of claims--constitutes the oldest\\nrelic\\nof this inheritance.  a god who begets children by a mortal woman;\\na\\nsage who demands that no more work be done, that no more justice be\\nadministered but that the signs of the approaching end of the world be\\nheeded; a system of justice that accepts an innocent as a vicarious\\nsacrifice in the place of the guilty; a person who bids his disciples\\ndrink his blood; prayers for miracles; sins against a god expiated\\nupon\\na god; fear of a hereafter to which death is the portal; the\\nfigure of\\nthe cross as a symbol in an age that no longer knows the\\npurpose and the\\nignominy of the cross--how ghostly all these things\\nflit before us out\\nof the grave of their primitive antiquity!  is one\\nto believe that such\\nthings can still be believed?\\n\\n\\n114\\n\\n=the un-\\ngreek in christianity.=--the greeks did not look upon the\\nhomeric gods\\nabove them as lords nor upon themselves beneath as\\nservants, after the\\nfashion of the jews.  they saw but the counterpart as\\nin a mirror of\\nthe most perfect specimens of their own caste, hence an\\nideal, but no\\ncontradiction of their own nature.  there was a feeling of\\nmutual\\nrelationship, resulting in a mutual interest, a sort of alliance.\\nman\\nthinks well of himself when he gives himself such gods and places\\nhimself in a relationship akin to that of the lower nobility with the\\nhigher; whereas the italian races have a decidedly vulgar religion,\\ninvolving perpetual anxiety because of bad and mischievous powers and\\nsoul disturbers.  wherever the olympian gods receded into the\\nbackground,\\nthere even greek life became gloomier and more perturbed.\\n--christianity,\\non the other hand, oppressed and degraded humanity\\ncompletely and sank\\nit into deepest mire: into the feeling of utter\\nabasement it suddenly\\nflashed the gleam of divine compassion, so that\\nthe amazed and\\ngrace-dazzled stupefied one gave a cry of delight and\\nfor a moment\\nbelieved that the whole of heaven was within him.  upon\\nthis unhealthy\\nexcess of feeling, upon the accompanying corruption of\\nheart and head,\\nchristianity attains all its psychological effects.\\nit wants to\\nannihilate, debase, stupefy, amaze, bedazzle.  there is\\nbut one thing\\nthat it does not want: measure, standard (das maas) and\\ntherefore is it\\nin the worst sense barbarous, asiatic, vulgar, un-\\ngreek.\\n\\n\\n115\\n\\n=being religious to some purpose.=--there are certain\\ninsipid,\\ntraffic-virtuous people to whom religion is pinned like the\\nhem of some\\ngarb of a higher humanity.  these people do well to remain\\nreligious: it\\nadorns them.  all who are not versed in some\\nprofessional\\nweapon--including tongue and pen as weapons--are servile:\\nto all such\\nthe christian religion is very useful, for then their\\nservility assumes\\nthe aspect of christian virtue and is amazingly\\nadorned.--people whose\\ndaily lives are empty and colorless are readily\\nreligious.  this is\\ncomprehensible and pardonable, but they have no\\nright to demand that\\nothers, whose daily lives are not empty and\\ncolorless, should be\\nreligious also.\\n\\n\\n116\\n\\n=the everyday\\nchristian.=--if christianity, with its allegations of an\\navenging god,\\nuniversal sinfulness, choice of grace, and the danger of\\neternal\\ndamnation, were true, it would be an indication of weakness of\\nmind\\nand character not to be a priest or an apostle or a hermit, and\\ntoil\\nfor one\\'s own salvation.  it would be irrational to lose sight of\\none\\'s eternal well being in comparison with temporary advantage:\\nassuming these dogmas to be generally believed, the every day\\nchristian\\nis a pitiable figure, a man who really cannot count as far\\nas three, and\\nwho, for the rest, just because of his intellectual\\nincapacity, does not\\ndeserve to be as hard punished as christianity\\npromises he shall be.\\n\\n\\n117\\n\\n=concerning the cleverness of\\nchristianity.=--it is a master stroke of\\nchristianity to so emphasize\\nthe unworthiness, sinfulness and\\ndegradation of men in general that\\ncontempt of one\\'s fellow creatures\\nbecomes impossible.  \"he may sin as\\nmuch as he pleases, he is not by\\nnature different from me.  it is i\\nwho in every way am unworthy and\\ncontemptible.\"  so says the christian\\nto himself.  but even this feeling\\nhas lost its keenest sting for the\\nchristian does not believe in his\\nindividual degradation.  he is bad\\nin his general human capacity and he\\nsoothes himself a little with the\\nassertion that we are all alike.\\n\\n\\n118\\n\\n=personal change.=--as soon as\\na religion rules, it has for its\\nopponents those who were its first\\ndisciples.\\n\\n\\n119\\n\\n=fate of christianity.=--christianity arose to\\nlighten the heart, but\\nnow it must first make the heart heavy in order\\nto be able to lighten it\\nafterwards.  christianity will consequently\\ngo down.\\n\\n\\n120\\n\\n=the testimony of pleasure.=--the agreeable opinion is\\naccepted as true.\\nthis is the testimony of pleasure (or as the church\\nsays, the evidence\\nof strength) of which all religions are so proud,\\nalthough they should\\nall be ashamed of it.  if a belief did not make\\nblessed it would not be\\nbelieved.  how little it would be worth, then!\\n121\\n\\n=dangerous play.=--whoever gives religious feeling room, must\\nthen also\\nlet it grow.  he can do nothing else.  then his being\\ngradually changes.\\nthe religious element brings with it affinities and\\nkinships.  the whole\\ncircle of his judgment and feeling is clouded and\\ndraped in religious\\nshadows.  feeling cannot stand still.  one should\\nbe on one\\'s guard.\\n\\n\\n122\\n\\n=the blind pupil.=--as long as one knows\\nvery well the strength and the\\nweakness of one\\'s dogma, one\\'s art,\\none\\'s religion, its strength is\\nstill low.  the pupil and apostle who\\nhas no eye for the weaknesses of a\\ndogma, a religion and so on,\\ndazzled by the aspect of the master and by\\nhis own reverence for him,\\nhas, on that very account, generally more\\npower than the master.\\nwithout blind pupils the influence of a man and\\nhis work has never\\nbecome great.  to give victory to knowledge, often\\namounts to no more\\nthan so allying it with stupidity that the brute\\nforce of the latter\\nforces triumph for the former.\\n\\n\\n123\\n\\n=the breaking off of\\nchurches.=--there is not sufficient religion in the\\nworld merely to\\nput an end to the number of religions.\\n\\n\\n124\\n\\n=sinlessness of\\nmen.=--if one have understood how \"sin came into the\\nworld,\" namely\\nthrough errors of the reason, through which men in their\\nintercourse\\nwith one another and even individual men looked upon\\nthemselves as\\nmuch blacker and wickeder than was really the case, one\\'s\\nwhole\\nfeeling is much lightened and man and the world appear together in\\nsuch a halo of harmlessness that a sentiment of well being is\\ninstilled\\ninto one\\'s whole nature.  man in the midst of nature is as a\\nchild left\\nto its own devices.  this child indeed dreams a heavy,\\nanxious dream.  but\\nwhen it opens its eyes it finds itself always in\\nparadise.\\n\\n\\n125\\n\\n=irreligiousness of artists.=--homer is so much at\\nhome among his gods\\nand is as a poet so good natured to them that he\\nmust have been\\nprofoundly irreligious.  that which was brought to him\\nby the popular\\nfaith--a mean, crude and partially repulsive\\nsuperstition--he dealt with\\nas freely as the sculptor with his clay,\\ntherefore with the same freedom\\nthat æschylus and aristophanes evinced\\nand with which in later times the\\ngreat artists of the renaissance,\\nand also shakespeare and goethe, drew\\ntheir pictures.\\n\\n\\n126\\n\\n=art and\\nstrength of false interpretation.=--all the visions, fears,\\nexhaustions and delights of the saint are well known symptoms of\\nsickness, which in him, owing to deep rooted religious and\\npsychological\\ndelusions, are explained quite differently, that is not\\nas symptoms of\\nsickness.--so, too, perhaps, the demon of socrates was\\nnothing but a\\nmalady of the ear that he explained, in view of his\\npredominant moral\\ntheory, in a manner different from what would be\\nthought rational\\nto-day.  nor is the case different with the frenzy\\nand the frenzied\\nspeeches of the prophets and of the priests of the\\noracles.  it is always\\nthe degree of wisdom, imagination, capacity and\\nmorality in the heart\\nand mind of the interpreters that got so much\\nout of them.  it is among\\nthe greatest feats of the men who are called\\ngeniuses and saints that\\nthey made interpreters for themselves who,\\nfortunately for mankind, did\\nnot understand them.\\n\\n\\n127\\n\\n=reverence\\nfor madness.=--because it was perceived that an excitement of\\nsome\\nkind often made the head clearer and occasioned fortunate\\ninspirations, it was concluded that the utmost excitement would\\noccasion\\nthe most fortunate inspirations.  hence the frenzied being\\nwas revered as\\na sage and an oracle giver.  a false conclusion lies at\\nthe bottom of all\\nthis.\\n\\n\\n128\\n\\n=promises of wisdom.=--modern science\\nhas as its object as little pain\\nas possible, as long a life as\\npossible--hence a sort of eternal\\nblessedness, but of a very limited\\nkind in comparison with the promises\\nof religion.\\n\\n\\n129\\n\\n=forbidden\\ngenerosity.=--there is not enough of love and goodness in the\\nworld to\\nthrow any of it away on conceited people.\\n\\n\\n130\\n\\n=survival of\\nreligious training in the disposition.=--the catholic\\nchurch, and\\nbefore it all ancient education, controlled the whole domain\\nof means\\nthrough which man was put into certain unordinary moods and\\nwithdrawn\\nfrom the cold calculation of personal advantage and from calm,\\nrational reflection.  a church vibrating with deep tones; gloomy,\\nregular, restraining exhortations from a priestly band, who\\ninvoluntarily communicate their own tension to their congregation and\\nlead them to listen almost with anxiety as if some miracle were in\\ncourse of preparation; the awesome pile of architecture which, as the\\nhouse of a god, rears itself vastly into the vague and in all its\\nshadowy nooks inspires fear of its nerve-exciting power--who would\\ncare\\nto reduce men to the level of these things if the ideas upon\\nwhich they\\nrest became extinct?  but the results of all these things\\nare\\nnevertheless not thrown away: the inner world of exalted,\\nemotional,\\nprophetic, profoundly repentant, hope-blessed moods has\\nbecome inborn in\\nman largely through cultivation.  what still exists\\nin his soul was\\nformerly, as he germinated, grew and bloomed,\\nthoroughly disciplined.\\n\\n\\n131\\n\\n=religious after-pains.=--though one\\nbelieve oneself absolutely weaned\\naway from religion, the process has\\nyet not been so thorough as to make\\nimpossible a feeling of joy at the\\npresence of religious feelings and\\ndispositions without intelligible\\ncontent, as, for example, in music;\\nand if a philosophy alleges to us\\nthe validity of metaphysical hopes,\\nthrough the peace of soul therein\\nattainable, and also speaks of \"the\\nwhole true gospel in the look of\\nraphael\\'s madonna,\" we greet such\\ndeclarations and innuendoes with a\\nwelcome smile.  the philosopher has\\nhere a matter easy of\\ndemonstration.  he responds with that which he is\\nglad to give, namely\\na heart that is glad to accept.  hence it is\\nobservable how the less\\nreflective free spirits collide only with dogmas\\nbut yield readily to\\nthe magic of religious feelings; it is a source of\\npain to them to let\\nthe latter go simply on account of the\\nformer.--scientific philosophy\\nmust be very much on its guard lest on\\naccount of this necessity--an\\nevolved and hence, also, a transitory\\nnecessity--delusions are\\nsmuggled in.  even logicians speak of\\n\"presentiments\" of truth in\\nethics and in art (for example of the\\npresentiment that the essence of\\nthings is unity) a thing which,\\nnevertheless, ought to be prohibited.\\nbetween carefully deduced truths\\nand such \"foreboded\" things there\\nlies the abysmal distinction that the\\nformer are products of the\\nintellect and the latter of the necessity.\\nhunger is no evidence that\\nthere is food at hand to appease it.  hunger\\nmerely craves food.\\n\"presentiment\" does not denote that the existence of\\na thing is known\\nin any way whatever.  it denotes merely that it is\\ndeemed possible to\\nthe extent that it is desired or feared.  the\\n\"presentiment\" is not\\none step forward in the domain of certainty.--it\\nis involuntarily\\nbelieved that the religious tinted sections of a\\nphilosophy are better\\nattested than the others, but the case is at\\nbottom just the opposite:\\nthere is simply the inner wish that it may be\\nso, that the thing which\\nbeautifies may also be true.  this wish leads us\\nto accept bad grounds\\nas good.\\n\\n\\n132\\n\\n=of the christian need of salvation.=--careful\\nconsideration must render\\nit possible to propound some explanation of\\nthat process in the soul of\\na christian which is termed need of\\nsalvation, and to propound an\\nexplanation, too, free from mythology:\\nhence one purely psychological.\\nheretofore psychological explanations\\nof religious conditions and\\nprocesses have really been in disrepute,\\ninasmuch as a theology calling\\nitself free gave vent to its\\nunprofitable nature in this domain; for its\\nprincipal aim, so far as\\nmay be judged from the spirit of its creator,\\nschleier-macher, was the\\npreservation of the christian religion and the\\nmaintenance of the\\nchristian theology.  it appeared that in the\\npsychological analysis of\\nreligious \"facts\" a new anchorage and above\\nall a new calling were to\\nbe gained.  undisturbed by such predecessors,\\nwe venture the following\\nexposition of the phenomena alluded to.  man is\\nconscious of certain\\nacts which are very firmly implanted in the general\\ncourse of conduct:\\nindeed he discovers in himself a predisposition to\\nsuch acts that\\nseems to him to be as unalterable as his very being.  how\\ngladly he\\nwould essay some other kind of acts which in the general\\nestimate of\\nconduct are rated the best and highest, how gladly he would\\nwelcome\\nthe consciousness of well doing which ought to follow unselfish\\nmotive!  unfortunately, however, it goes no further than this longing:\\nthe discontent consequent upon being unable to satisfy it is added to\\nall other kinds of discontent which result from his life destiny in\\nparticular or which may be due to so called bad acts; so that a deep\\ndepression ensues accompanied by a desire for some physician to remove\\nit and all its causes.--this condition would not be found so bitter if\\nthe individual but compared himself freely with other men: for then he\\nwould have no reason to be discontented with himself in particular as\\nhe\\nis merely bearing his share of the general burden of human\\ndiscontent\\nand incompleteness.  but he compares himself with a being\\nwho alone must\\nbe capable of the conduct that is called unegoistic and\\nof an enduring\\nconsciousness of unselfish motive, with god.  it is\\nbecause he gazes into\\nthis clear mirror, that his own self seems so\\nextraordinarily distracted\\nand so troubled.  thereupon the thought of\\nthat being, in so far as it\\nflits before his fancy as retributive\\njustice, occasions him anxiety.  in\\nevery conceivable small and great\\nexperience he believes he sees the\\nanger of the being, his threats,\\nthe very implements and manacles of his\\njudge and prison.  what\\nsuccors him in this danger, which, in the\\nprospect of an eternal\\nduration of punishment, transcends in hideousness\\nall the horrors that\\ncan be presented to the imagination?\\n\\n\\n133\\n\\nbefore we consider this\\ncondition in its further effects, we would admit\\nto ourselves that man\\nis betrayed into this condition not through his\\n\"fault\" and \"sin\" but\\nthrough a series of delusions of the reason; that\\nit was the fault of\\nthe mirror if his own self appeared to him in the\\nhighest degree dark\\nand hateful, and that that mirror was his own work,\\nthe very imperfect\\nwork of human imagination and judgment.  in the first\\nplace a being\\ncapable of absolutely unegoistic conduct is as fabulous as\\nthe\\nphoenix.  such a being is not even thinkable for the very reason that\\nthe whole notion of \"unegoistic conduct,\" when closely examined,\\nvanishes into air.  never yet has a man done anything solely for\\nothers\\nand entirely without reference to a personal motive; indeed how\\ncould he\\npossibly do anything that had no reference to himself, that\\nis without\\ninward compulsion (which must always have its basis in a\\npersonal need)?\\nhow could the ego act without ego?--a god, who, on the\\nother hand, is\\nall love, as he is usually represented, would not be\\ncapable of a\\nsolitary unegoistic act: whence one is reminded of a\\nreflection of\\nlichtenberg\\'s which is, in truth, taken from a lower\\nsphere: \"we cannot\\npossibly feel for others, as the expression goes;\\nwe feel only for\\nourselves.  the assertion sounds hard, but it is not,\\nif rightly\\nunderstood.  a man loves neither his father nor his mother\\nnor his wife\\nnor his child, but simply the feelings which they\\ninspire.\"  or, as la\\nrochefoucauld says: \"if you think you love your\\nmistress for the mere\\nlove of her, you are very much mistaken.\"  why\\nacts of love are more\\nhighly prized than others, namely not on account\\nof their nature, but on\\naccount of their utility, has already been\\nexplained in the section on\\nthe origin of moral feelings.  but if a\\nman should wish to be all love\\nlike the god aforesaid, and want to do\\nall things for others and nothing\\nfor himself, the procedure would be\\nfundamentally impossible because he\\n_must_ do a great deal for himself\\nbefore there would be any possibility\\nof doing anything for the love\\nof others.  it is also essential that\\nothers be sufficiently egoistic\\nto accept always and at all times this\\nself sacrifice and living for\\nothers, so that the men of love and self\\nsacrifice have an interest in\\nthe survival of unloving and selfish\\negoists, while the highest\\nmorality, in order to maintain itself must\\nformally enforce the\\nexistence of immorality (wherein it would be really\\ndestroying\\nitself.)--further: the idea of a god perturbs and discourages\\nas long\\nas it is accepted but as to how it originated can no longer, in\\nthe\\npresent state of comparative ethnological science, be a matter of\\ndoubt, and with the insight into the origin of this belief all faith\\ncollapses.  what happens to the christian who compares his nature with\\nthat of god is exactly what happened to don quixote, who depreciated\\nhis\\nown prowess because his head was filled with the wondrous deeds of\\nthe\\nheroes of chivalrous romance.  the standard of measurement which\\nboth\\nemploy belongs to the domain of fable.--but if the idea of god\\ncollapses, so too, does the feeling of \"sin\" as a violation of divine\\nrescript, as a stain upon a god-like creation.  there still apparently\\nremains that discouragement which is closely allied with fear of the\\npunishment of worldly justice or of the contempt of one\\'s fellow men.\\nthe keenest thorn in the sentiment of sin is dulled when it is\\nperceived\\nthat one\\'s acts have contravened human tradition, human\\nrules and human\\nlaws without having thereby endangered the \"eternal\\nsalvation of the\\nsoul\" and its relations with deity.  if finally men\\nattain to the\\nconviction of the absolute necessity of all acts and of\\ntheir utter\\nirresponsibility and then absorb it into their flesh and\\nblood, every\\nrelic of conscience pangs will disappear.\\n\\n\\n134\\n\\nif now,\\nas stated, the christian, through certain delusive feelings, is\\nbetrayed into self contempt, that is by a false and unscientific view\\nof\\nhis acts and feelings, he must, nevertheless, perceive with the\\nutmost\\namazement that this state of self contempt, of conscience\\npangs, of\\ndespair in particular, does not last, that there are hours\\nduring which\\nall these things are wafted away from the soul and he\\nfeels himself once\\nmore free and courageous.  the truth is that joy in\\nhis own being, the\\nfulness of his own powers in connection with the\\ninevitable decline of\\nhis profound excitation with the lapse of time,\\nbore off the palm of\\nvictory.  the man loves himself once more, he\\nfeels it--but this very new\\nlove, this new self esteem seems to him\\nincredible.  he can see in it\\nonly the wholly unmerited stream of the\\nlight of grace shed down upon\\nhim.  if he formerly saw in every event\\nmerely warnings, threats,\\npunishments and every kind of indication of\\ndivine anger, he now reads\\ninto his experiences the grace of god.  the\\nlatter circumstance seems to\\nhim full of love, the former as a helpful\\npointing of the way, and his\\nentirely joyful frame of mind now seems\\nto him to be an absolute proof\\nof the goodness of god.  as formerly in\\nhis states of discouragement he\\ninterpreted his conduct falsely so now\\nhe does the same with his\\nexperiences.  his state of consolation is\\nnow regarded as the effect\\nproduced by some external power.  the love\\nwith which, at bottom, he\\nloves himself, seems to be the divine love.\\nthat which he calls grace\\nand the preliminary of salvation is in\\nreality self-grace,\\nself-salvation.\\n\\n\\n135\\n\\ntherefore a certain false\\npsychology, a certain kind of imaginativeness\\nin the interpretation of\\nmotives and experiences is the essential\\npreliminary to being a\\nchristian and to experiencing the need of\\nsalvation.  upon gaining an\\ninsight into this wandering of the reason and\\nthe imagination, one\\nceases to be a christian.\\n\\n\\n136\\n\\n=of christian asceticism and\\nsanctity.=--much as some thinkers have\\nexerted themselves to impart an\\nair of the miraculous to those singular\\nphenomena known as asceticism\\nand sanctity, to question which or to\\naccount for which upon a\\nrational basis would be wickedness and\\nsacrilege, the temptation to\\nthis wickedness is none the less great.  a\\npowerful impulse of nature\\nhas in every age led to protest against such\\nphenomena.  at any rate\\nscience, inasmuch as it is the imitation of\\nnature, permits the\\ncasting of doubts upon the inexplicable character\\nand the supernal\\ndegree of such phenomena.  it is true that heretofore\\nscience has not\\nsucceeded in its attempts at explanation.  the phenomena\\nremain\\nunexplained still, to the great satisfaction of those who revere\\nmoral\\nmiracles.  for, speaking generally, the unexplained must rank as\\nthe\\ninexplicable, the inexplicable as the non-natural, supernatural,\\nmiraculous--so runs the demand in the souls of all the religious and\\nall\\nthe metaphysicians (even the artists if they happen to be\\nthinkers),\\nwhereas the scientific man sees in this demand the \"evil\\nprinciple.\"--the universal, first, apparent truth that is encountered\\nin\\nthe contemplation of sanctity and asceticism is that their nature\\nis\\ncomplicated; for nearly always, within the physical world as well\\nas in\\nthe moral, the apparently miraculous may be traced successfully\\nto the\\ncomplex, the obscure, the multi-conditioned.  let us venture\\nthen to\\nisolate a few impulses in the soul of the saint and the\\nascetic, to\\nconsider them separately and then view them as a synthetic\\ndevelopment.\\n\\n\\n137\\n\\nthere is an obstinacy against oneself, certain\\nsublimated forms of which\\nare included in asceticism.  certain kinds\\nof men are under such a strong\\nnecessity of exercising their power and\\ndominating impulses that, if\\nother objects are lacking or if they have\\nnot succeeded with other\\nobjects they will actually tyrannize over\\nsome portions of their own\\nnature or over sections and stages of their\\nown personality.  thus do\\nmany thinkers bring themselves to views\\nwhich are far from likely to\\nincrease or improve their fame.  many\\ndeliberately bring down the\\ncontempt of others upon themselves\\nalthough they could easily have\\nretained consideration by silence.\\nothers contradict earlier opinions\\nand do not shrink from the ordeal\\nof being deemed inconsistent.  on the\\ncontrary they strive for this\\nand act like eager riders who enjoy\\nhorseback exercise most when the\\nhorse is skittish.  thus will men in\\ndangerous paths ascend to the\\nhighest steeps in order to laugh to scorn\\ntheir own fear and their own\\ntrembling limbs.  thus will the philosopher\\nembrace the dogmas of\\nasceticism, humility, sanctity, in the light of\\nwhich his own image\\nappears in its most hideous aspect.  this crushing of\\nself, this\\nmockery of one\\'s own nature, this spernere se sperni out of\\nwhich\\nreligions have made so much is in reality but a very high\\ndevelopment\\nof vanity.  the whole ethic of the sermon on the mount\\nbelongs in this\\ncategory: man has a true delight in mastering himself\\nthrough\\nexaggerated pretensions or excessive expedients and later\\ndeifying\\nthis tyrannically exacting something within him.  in every\\nscheme of\\nascetic ethics, man prays to one part of himself as if it were\\ngod and\\nhence it is necessary for him to treat the rest of himself as\\ndevil.\\n138\\n\\n=man is not at all hours equally moral=; this is established.  if\\none\\'s\\nmorality be judged according to one\\'s capacity for great, self\\nsacrificing resolutions and abnegations (which when continual, and\\nmade\\na habit are known as sanctity) one is, in affection, or\\ndisposition, the\\nmost moral: while higher excitement supplies wholly\\nnew impulses which,\\nwere one calm and cool as ordinarily, one would\\nnot deem oneself even\\ncapable of.  how comes this?  apparently from\\nthe propinquity of all great\\nand lofty emotional states.  if a man is\\nbrought to an extraordinary\\npitch of feeling he can resolve upon a\\nfearful revenge or upon a fearful\\nrenunciation of his thirst for\\nvengeance indifferently.  he craves, under\\nthe influences of powerful\\nemotion, the great, the powerful, the\\nimmense, and if he chances to\\nperceive that the sacrifice of himself\\nwill afford him as much\\nsatisfaction as the sacrifice of another, or\\nwill afford him more, he\\nwill choose self sacrifice.  what concerns him\\nparticularly is simply\\nthe unloading of his emotion.  hence he readily,\\nto relieve his\\ntension, grasps the darts of the enemy and buries them in\\nhis own\\nbreast.  that in self abnegation and not in revenge the element\\nof\\ngreatness consisted must have been brought home to mankind only after\\nlong habituation.  a god who sacrifices himself would be the most\\npowerful and most effective symbol of this sort of greatness.  as the\\nconquest of the most hardly conquered enemy, the sudden mastering of a\\npassion--thus does such abnegation _appear_: hence it passes for the\\nsummit of morality.  in reality all that is involved is the exchange\\nof\\none idea for another whilst the temperament remained at a like\\naltitude,\\na like tidal state.  men when coming out of the spell, or\\nresting from\\nsuch passionate excitation, no longer understand the\\nmorality of such\\ninstants, but the admiration of all who participated\\nin the occasion\\nsustains them.  pride is their support if the passion\\nand the\\ncomprehension of their act weaken.  therefore, at bottom even\\nsuch acts\\nof self-abnegation are not moral inasmuch as they are not\\ndone with a\\nstrict regard for others.  rather do others afford the\\nhigh strung\\ntemperament an opportunity to lighten itself through such\\nabnegation.\\n\\n\\n139\\n\\n=even the ascetic seeks to make life easier=, and\\ngenerally by means of\\nabsolute subjection to another will or to an all\\ninclusive rule and\\nritual, pretty much as the brahmin leaves\\nabsolutely nothing to his own\\nvolition but is guided in every moment\\nof his life by some holy\\ninjunction or other.  this subjection is a\\npotent means of acquiring\\ndominion over oneself.  one is occupied,\\nhence time does not bang heavy\\nand there is no incitement of the\\npersonal will and of the individual\\npassion.  the deed once done there\\nis no feeling of responsibility nor\\nthe sting of regret.  one has\\ngiven up one\\'s own will once for all and\\nthis is easier than to give\\nit up occasionally, as it is also easier\\nwholly to renounce a desire\\nthan to yield to it in measured degree.  when\\nwe consider the present\\nrelation of man to the state we perceive\\nunconditional obedience is\\neasier than conditional.  the holy person also\\nmakes his lot easier\\nthrough the complete surrender of his life\\npersonality and it is all\\ndelusion to admire such a phenomenon as the\\nloftiest heroism of\\nmorality.  it is always more difficult to assert\\none\\'s personality\\nwithout shrinking and without hesitation than to give\\nit up altogether\\nin the manner indicated, and it requires moreover more\\nintellect and\\nthought.\\n\\n\\n140\\n\\nafter having discovered in many of the less\\ncomprehensible actions mere\\nmanifestations of pleasure in emotion for\\nits own sake, i fancy i can\\ndetect in the self contempt which\\ncharacterises holy persons, and also\\nin their acts of self torture\\n(through hunger and scourgings,\\ndistortions and chaining of the limbs,\\nacts of madness) simply a means\\nwhereby such natures may resist the\\ngeneral exhaustion of their will to\\nlive (their nerves). they employ\\nthe most painful expedients to escape\\nif only for a time from the\\nheaviness and weariness in which they are\\nsteeped by their great\\nmental indolence and their subjection to a will\\nother than their own.\\n141\\n\\n=the most usual means= by which the ascetic and the sanctified\\nindividual seeks to make life more endurable comprises certain combats\\nof an inner nature involving alternations of victory and prostration.\\nfor this purpose an enemy is necessary and he is found in the so\\ncalled\\n\"inner enemy.\"  that is, the holy individual makes use of his\\ntendency to\\nvanity, domineering and pride, and of his mental longings\\nin order to\\ncontemplate his life as a sort of continuous battle and\\nhimself as a\\nbattlefield, in which good and evil spirits wage war with\\nvarying\\nfortune.  it is an established fact that the imagination is\\nrestrained\\nthrough the regularity and adequacy of sexual intercourse\\nwhile on the\\nother hand abstention from or great irregularity in\\nsexual intercourse\\nwill cause the imagination to run riot.  the\\nimaginations of many of the\\nchristian saints were obscene to a degree;\\nand because of the theory\\nthat sexual desires were in reality demons\\nthat raged within them, the\\nsaints did not feel wholly responsible for\\nthem.  it is to this\\nconviction that we are indebted for the highly\\ninstructive sincerity of\\ntheir evidence against themselves.  it was to\\ntheir interest that this\\ncontest should always be kept up in some\\nfashion because by means of\\nthis contest, as already stated, their\\nempty lives gained distraction.\\nin order that the contest might seem\\nsufficiently great to inspire\\nsympathy and admiration in the\\nunsanctified, it was essential that\\nsexual capacity be ever more and\\nmore damned and denounced.  indeed the\\ndanger of eternal damnation was\\nso closely allied to this capacity that\\nfor whole generations\\nchristians showed their children with actual\\nconscience pangs.  what\\nevil may not have been done to humanity through\\nthis!  and yet here\\nthe truth is just upside down: an exceedingly\\nunseemly attitude for\\nthe truth.  christianity, it is true, had said that\\nevery man is\\nconceived and born in sin, and in the intolerable and\\nexcessive\\nchristianity of calderon this thought is again perverted and\\nentangled\\ninto the most distorted paradox extant in the well known lines\\nthe greatest sin of man\\n     is the sin of being born.\\n\\nin all\\npessimistic religions the act of procreation is looked upon as\\nevil in\\nitself.  this is far from being the general human opinion.  it is\\nnot\\neven the opinion of all pessimists.  empedocles, for example, knows\\nnothing of anything shameful, devilish and sinful in it.  he sees\\nrather\\nin the great field of bliss of unholiness simply a healthful\\nand hopeful\\nphenomenon, aphrodite.  she is to him an evidence that\\nstrife does not\\nalways rage but that some time a gentle demon is to\\nwield the sceptre.\\nthe christian pessimists of practice, had, as\\nstated, a direct interest\\nin the prevalence of an opposite belief.\\nthey needed in the loneliness\\nand the spiritual wilderness of their\\nlives an ever living enemy, and a\\nuniversally known enemy through\\nwhose conquest they might appear to the\\nunsanctified as utterly\\nincomprehensible and half unnatural beings.  when\\nthis enemy at last,\\nas a result of their mode of life and their\\nshattered health, took\\nflight forever, they were able immediately to\\npeople their inner\\nselves with new demons.  the rise and fall of the\\nbalance of\\ncheerfulness and despair maintained their addled brains in a\\ntotally\\nnew fluctuation of longing and peace of soul.  and in that period\\npsychology served not only to cast suspicion on everything human but\\nto\\nwound and scourge it, to crucify it.  man wanted to find himself as\\nbase\\nand evil as possible.  man sought to become anxious about the\\nstate of\\nhis soul, he wished to be doubtful of his own capacity.\\neverything\\nnatural with which man connects the idea of badness and\\nsinfulness (as,\\nfor instance, is still customary in regard to the\\nerotic) injures and\\ndegrades the imagination, occasions a shamed\\naspect, leads man to war\\nupon himself and makes him uncertain,\\ndistrustful of himself.  even his\\ndreams acquire a tincture of the\\nunclean conscience.  and yet this\\nsuffering because of the natural\\nelement in certain things is wholly\\nsuperfluous.  it is simply the\\nresult of opinions regarding the things.\\nit is easy to understand why\\nmen become worse than they are if they are\\nbrought to look upon the\\nunavoidably natural as bad and later to feel it\\nas of evil origin.  it\\nis the master stroke of religions and metaphysics\\nthat wish to make\\nman out bad and sinful by nature, to render nature\\nsuspicious in his\\neyes and to so make himself evil, for he learns to\\nfeel himself evil\\nwhen he cannot divest himself of nature.  he gradually\\ncomes to look\\nupon himself, after a long life lived naturally, so\\noppressed by a\\nweight of sin that supernatural powers become necessary\\nto relieve him\\nof the burden; and with this notion comes the so called\\nneed of\\nsalvation, which is the result not of a real but of an imaginary\\nsinfulness.  go through the separate moral expositions in the vouchers\\nof\\nchristianity and it will always be found that the demands are\\nexcessive\\nin order that it may be impossible for man to satisfy them.\\nthe object\\nis not that he may become moral but that he may feel as\\nsinful as\\npossible.  if this feeling had not been rendered agreeable\\nto man--why\\nshould he have improvised such an ideal and clung to it so\\nlong?  as in\\nthe ancient world an incalculable strength of intellect\\nand capacity for\\nfeeling was squandered in order to increase the joy\\nof living through\\nfeastful systems of worship, so in the era of\\nchristianity an equally\\nincalculable quantity of intellectual capacity\\nhas been sacrificed in\\nanother endeavor: that man should in every way\\nfeel himself sinful and\\nthereby be moved, inspired, inspirited.  to\\nmove, to inspire, to inspirit\\nat any cost--is not this the freedom cry\\nof an exhausted, over-ripe,\\nover cultivated age?  the circle of all\\nthe natural sensations had been\\ngone through a hundred times: the soul\\nhad grown weary.  then the saints\\nand the ascetics found a new order\\nof ecstacies.  they set themselves\\nbefore the eyes of all not alone as\\nmodels for imitation to many, but as\\nfearful and yet delightful\\nspectacles on the boundary line between this\\nworld and the next world,\\nwhere in that period everyone thought he saw\\nat one time rays of\\nheavenly light, at another fearful, threatening\\ntongues of flame.  the\\neye of the saint, directed upon the fearful\\nsignificance of the\\nshortness of earthly life, upon the imminence of the\\nlast judgment,\\nupon eternal life hereafter; this glowering eye in an\\nemaciated body\\ncaused men, in the old time world, to tremble to the\\ndepths of their\\nbeing.  to look, to look away and shudder, to feel anew\\nthe\\nfascination of the spectacle, to yield to it, sate oneself upon it\\nuntil the soul trembled with ardor and fever--that was the last\\npleasure\\nleft to classical antiquity when its sensibilities had been\\nblunted by\\nthe arena and the gladiatorial show.\\n\\n\\n142\\n\\n=to sum up all\\nthat has been said=: that condition of soul at which the\\nsaint or\\nexpectant saint is rejoiced is a combination of elements which\\nwe are\\nall familiar with, except that under other influences than those\\nof\\nmere religious ideation they customarily arouse the censure of men in\\nthe same way that when combined with religion itself and regarded as\\nthe\\nsupreme attainment of sanctity, they are object of admiration and\\neven\\nof prayer--at least in more simple times.  very soon the saint\\nturns upon\\nhimself that severity that is so closely allied to the\\ninstinct of\\ndomination at any price and which inspire even in the most\\nsolitary\\nindividual the sense of power.  soon his swollen\\nsensitiveness of feeling\\nbreaks forth from the longing to restrain his\\npassions within it and is\\ntransformed into a longing to master them as\\nif they were wild steeds,\\nthe master impulse being ever that of a\\nproud spirit; next he craves a\\ncomplete cessation of all perturbing,\\nfascinating feelings, a waking\\nsleep, an enduring repose in the lap of\\na dull, animal, plant-like\\nindolence.  next he seeks the battle and\\nextinguishes it within himself\\nbecause weariness and boredom confront\\nhim.  he binds his\\nself-deification with self-contempt.  he delights\\nin the wild tumult of\\nhis desires and the sharp pain of sin, in the\\nvery idea of being lost.\\nhe is able to play his very passions, for\\ninstance the desire to\\ndomineer, a trick so that he goes to the other\\nextreme of abject\\nhumiliation and subjection, so that his overwrought\\nsoul is without any\\nrestraint through this antithesis.  and, finally,\\nwhen indulgence in\\nvisions, in talks with the dead or with divine\\nbeings overcomes him,\\nthis is really but a form of gratification that\\nhe craves, perhaps a\\nform of gratification in which all other\\ngratifications are blended.\\nnovalis, one of the authorities in matters\\nof sanctity, because of his\\nexperience and instinct, betrays the whole\\nsecret with the utmost\\nsimplicity when he says: \"it is remarkable that\\nthe close connection of\\ngratification, religion and cruelty has not\\nlong ago made men aware of\\ntheir inner relationship and common\\ntendency.\"\\n\\n\\n143\\n\\n=not what the saint is but what he was in= the eyes\\nof the\\nnon-sanctified gives him his historical importance.  because\\nthere\\nexisted a delusion respecting the saint, his soul states being\\nfalsely\\nviewed and his personality being sundered as much as possible\\nfrom\\nhumanity as a something incomparable and supernatural, because of\\nthese\\nthings he attained the extraordinary with which he swayed the\\nimaginations of whole nations and whole ages.  even he knew himself\\nnot\\nfor even he regarded his dispositions, passions and actions in\\naccordance with a system of interpretation as artificial and\\nexaggerated\\nas the pneumatic interpretation of the bible.  the\\ndistorted and diseased\\nin his own nature with its blending of\\nspiritual poverty, defective\\nknowledge, ruined health, overwrought\\nnerves, remained as hidden from\\nhis view as from the view of his\\nbeholders.  he was neither a\\nparticularly good man nor a particularly\\nbad man but he stood for\\nsomething that was far above the human\\nstandard in wisdom and goodness.\\nfaith in him sustained faith in the\\ndivine and miraculous, in a\\nreligious significance of all existence,\\nin an impending day of\\njudgment.  in the last rays of the setting sun\\nof the ancient world,\\nwhich fell upon the christian peoples, the\\nshadowy form of the saint\\nattained enormous proportions--to such\\nenormous proportions, indeed,\\nthat down even to our own age, which no\\nlonger believes in god, there\\nare thinkers who believe in the saints.\\n144\\n\\nit stands to reason that this sketch of the saint, made upon the\\nmodel\\nof the whole species, can be confronted with many opposing\\nsketches that\\nwould create a more agreeable impression.  there are\\ncertain exceptions\\namong the species who distinguish themselves either\\nby especial\\ngentleness or especial humanity, and perhaps by the\\nstrength of their\\nown personality.  others are in the highest degree\\nfascinating because\\ncertain of their delusions shed a particular glow\\nover their whole\\nbeing, as is the case with the founder of\\nchristianity who took himself\\nfor the only begotten son of god and\\nhence felt himself sinless; so that\\nthrough his imagination--that\\nshould not be too harshly judged since the\\nwhole of antiquity swarmed\\nwith sons of god--he attained the same goal,\\nthe sense of complete\\nsinlessness, complete irresponsibility, that can\\nnow be attained by\\nevery individual through science.--in the same manner\\ni have viewed\\nthe saints of india who occupy an intermediate station\\nbetween the\\nchristian saints and the greek philosophers and hence are\\nnot to be\\nregarded as a pure type.  knowledge and science--as far as they\\nexisted--and superiority to the rest of mankind by logical discipline\\nand training of the intellectual powers were insisted upon by the\\nbuddhists as essential to sanctity, just as they were denounced by the\\nchristian world as the indications of sinfulness.'"
