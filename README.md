# Text Generation with GPT-2

## Project Overview
This project focuses on generating text using the GPT-2 model, a powerful generative language model developed by OpenAI. The project demonstrates various text generation techniques including Greedy Search, Beam Search, Random Sampling, Top-k Sampling, and Nucleus Sampling. These techniques are used to explore different strategies for generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
